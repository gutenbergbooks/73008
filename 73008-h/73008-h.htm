<p>“<span class="smcap">Ted</span>! Teddy! Where are you?”</p>

<p>Janet Martin stood in the hall and called
to her brother.</p>

<p>“Here I am, in the bathroom,” he answered.</p>

<p>“What you doing?”</p>

<p>“Combin’ my hair.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you forgot to put your ‘g’ on!”
shouted Janet. “You forgot to put your
‘g’ on!” and she clapped her hands as
though at some joke.</p>

<p>“I don’t need any ‘g’ on my hair,” declared
Ted, opening the bathroom door and
looking out at his sister. “I put on some
of the switch-hazel daddy uses when he
shaves. It smells good. Want some?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>“Nope, I’ve combed my hair and it’s all
fixed now. But you didn’t put your ‘g’ on
combing, and I haven’t dropped any of my
‘g’s’ to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was in a hurry,” explained Ted,
now using the comb with both hands, the
more quickly to get his hair in order.</p>

<p>The children’s mother was trying to teach
them to speak correctly, and not drop the
‘g’ of the words where it belonged. Sometimes
they forgot, and at other times they
remembered. Once in a while Janet would
remind Teddy that he had forgotten, and,
again, it would be his turn to tease her a
little.</p>

<p>“Hurry up and come on out!” cried
Janet. “We can have some fun in the swing
and hammock. This is the first week of
vacation, and we want to have some fun!”</p>

<p>“I’m hurryin’—I mean hurrying—as fast
as I can, but my hair is all snarls, and mother’ll
send me back to fix it if I don’t comb it.
Wow! That pulled!”</p>

<p>Ted made such a funny face as the comb
became tangled in his tightly curling hair
that Janet laughed.</p>

<p>“Huh! you wouldn’t giggle if it happened
to you!” protested Ted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>“Mine was all snarly too, but Nora helped
me,” said Janet. “Wait, Ted, I’ll comb it
out for you and then we can go and play,”
and she ran toward the bathroom, reaching
out her hand for the comb.</p>

<p>“You won’t hurt, will you?” asked Ted,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Nope! I’ll do it easy.”</p>

<p>Jan took hold of the comb, but no sooner
had she started to pull it through her brother’s
tangle of hair than he gave a howl, almost
like those he used when he was playing
Indians with the boys and pretended to be
on the warpath.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Don’t yell so!”
cried Jan.</p>

<p>“You pull like anything!”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t help it. The comb is caught
fast, or something! I’ve got to get it out,”
and the little girl did her best to untangle
the snarls.</p>

<p>“Ouch! Let it alone!” again Ted howled,
and this time his mother’s voice called up
from the foot of the stairs:</p>

<p>“What <i>are</i> you children doing now?”</p>

<p>“I’m combing Ted’s hair,” answered
Janet.</p>

<p>“She’s pullin’ it,” declared Ted, and this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
time his sister did not mention the dropped
“g.” “She pulls awful! The comb’s
stuck!”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. I’ll come up,” said
Mother Martin with a half sigh as she started
up the stairs, for there was much to do that
day and she had hoped that the children
could get themselves ready for their play.</p>

<p>“Where’s the comb?” she asked, as she
entered the bathroom.</p>

<p>“Ted has it,” answered Jan. “He wouldn’t
let me do anything for him.”</p>

<p>“She pulled too much,” her brother explained.</p>

<p>“I don’t see the comb,” remarked Mrs.
Martin.</p>

<p>“It’s on my head—in my hair,” explained
Ted further.</p>

<p>If you had been there to see him you would
not have wondered that he was called
“Curlytop” about as often as he was by his
regular name. Jan had the same tightly
curling hair as her brother, and the two children
were often spoken of, even by strangers,
as “The Curlytops.” The name just
fitted them.</p>

<p>“No wonder I couldn’t see it,” said Mrs.
Martin, as she gently brushed aside the hair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
on top of her little boy’s head and saw the
comb caught in a tangle of curls. “It’s hidden
like a hen’s egg in a nest of hay. Stand
still now, and I’ll soon have you looking
nice and tidy.”</p>

<p>If Ted’s mother pulled his hair he did not
speak of it. Once or twice he caught his
breath as though about to give a cry, but he
held it back, and finally, nicely combed and
brushed, he was ready to run downstairs
with his sister.</p>

<p>“If their hair keeps on growing and curling,”
said Mrs. Martin as she put the bathroom
in order, “they’ll be losing more things
in it than combs. Look after Baby
William!” she called to Ted and Jan from
the window, as she saw them down in the
yard.</p>

<p>“We will,” promised Jan.</p>

<p>“Where is Trouble?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“Out in the hammock. But don’t swing
him too high, or he may fall out,” answered
his mother.</p>

<p>“All right,” assented Jan.</p>

<p>Trouble was the nickname given to the
baby brother of Jan and Ted. He was about
three years old, and often got into mischief.
That was why he was called Trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>It was a beautiful, sunshiny day—the last
of June—and Monday morning. It was the
beginning of the long summer vacation,
school having closed the Friday before.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll have some fun!” laughed Ted
as he ran over the thick, green grass and
turned a somersault. “Let’s build a tent and
play Indians.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to play that,” objected Jan.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll get Tom Taylor,” declared
Ted. “Here he comes now,” and he pointed
to a boy, a little larger than himself, who was
walking along the street whistling.</p>

<p>“Here’s the letter man,” added Jan, as
she saw the mail-carrier approaching. “I
wonder if he’s got anything for us.”</p>

<p>She ran to the low hedge that was between
the Martin side yard and the street, and
Ted followed.</p>

<p>“Hello, Curlytops!” was the postman’s
greeting. “Here’s the mail for you. Don’t
lose it,” and he handed Jan two letters.
“Any birds been nesting in your hair to-day?”
he asked Ted, putting his hand over
the hedge and ruffling up the boy’s curls.</p>

<p>“Nope!” answered Ted.</p>

<p>“He lost the comb in it and mother
couldn’t find it,” Jan put in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>“I should think not!” agreed the postman,
laughing. “If I had such a head of
hair as you two youngsters have, I’d be
afraid of losing my whistle in the curls.
Then I’d have to stop being a postman until
I found it. But run along with the letters,
Jan. Your mother may be waiting for
them.”</p>

<p>He gave a blast on his whistle, and crossed
the street, while Jan hurried into the house
and Ted waved to Tom Taylor, calling:</p>

<p>“Come on in and we’ll play Indians.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Tom.</p>

<p>He wiggled his way through a hole in the
hedge, not waiting to go around to the gate,
and he and Ted started for a shady spot under
the trees, where Jan soon joined them.</p>

<p>“Come on down to the back lot,” urged
Ted. “We’ll get a blanket and make a tent
like the Indians. Jan can be a squaw if she
wants to.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to,” Jan said quickly. “I’m
going over and play with Edna Lewis.”</p>

<p>“I’ll play Indian in a minute,” promised
Tom. “Let’s rest a bit. I just went to the
store for my mother. She says I must help a
little, even if it is vacation. I like to help,
though,” he added quickly. “She gave me a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
penny for going to the store. Where are
you Curlytops going on your vacation?” he
asked, and then, without waiting for an answer,
he added quickly: “I’m going down
to the ocean.”</p>

<p>“We were there once,” said Janet. “It’s
an awful big place.”</p>

<p>“We’re goin’ to grandpa’s farm,” said
Teddy, and this time Jan did not speak about
the “g” he dropped. Perhaps she was thinking
too much about vacation fun.</p>

<p>“Are we really going there, Ted?” she
asked her brother.</p>

<p>“Yep! Mother and daddy were talking
about it last night. We’re to go to Cherry
Farm and stay all summer. Oh, what fun
we’ll have!”</p>

<p>“I’ll have fun at the ocean, too,” added
Tom. “But what makes ’em call your
grandpa’s place Cherry Farm?”</p>

<p>“’Cause it’s got so many cherry trees on
it,” explained Ted. “You ought to see ’em!
There’s more’n a million!”</p>

<p>“There can’t be that many cherry trees
in the whole world,” objected Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s a hundred, anyhow,” declared
Ted. “I’ve seen ’em, an’ I’m going to
eat a lot of cherries.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“I wish I had some now,” sighed Tom.</p>

<p>“It isn’t time for ’em to be ripe, yet,” explained
Janet. “Maybe we could send you
some when they are,” she kindly added.
“It’s an awful nice place at Cherry Farm.
I wish you could come with us, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll have fun down at the ocean.
I’m going to sail a boat on it. Maybe I’ll be
shipwrecked,” and Tom seemed to think
that would be great fun.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want to be shipwrecked,” remarked
Ted. “My mother read me a story
once about a sailor that was wrecked, and
he didn’t have a thing to eat but his old
shoes.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he have any bread an’ butter with
’im?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Nope.”</p>

<p>“Then I guess I won’t be shipwrecked,”
decided Tom. “I like bread and butter.”</p>

<p>“You could be shipwrecked on my grandpa’s
farm, and eat cherries,” suggested Jan.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” exclaimed Tom. “You couldn’t
be shipwrecked without an ocean, and there
isn’t any ocean on Cherry Farm I guess.”</p>

<p>“There’s a lake!” returned Teddy
quickly. “I’m going to sail a boat on that,
and maybe I’ll be shipwrecked. I’ll take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
some cherries with me, though. I guess I’ll
go and fix my small sailboat now. That’ll
be more fun than playin’ Indian.”</p>

<p>“And I’ve got to wash my doll’s dress,”
said Jan. “Oh, look!” she called to her
brother. “There’s mother in the door waving
to us.”</p>

<p>“She wants us to run, I guess,” added
Ted, “for she’s waving awful hard.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what she does want,” murmured
Jan.</p>

<p>“Maybe she wants us to go to the store,”
suggested Ted. “She’s got a paper in her
hand like she writes down things so we don’t
forget to remember.”</p>

<p>“That’s the letter I gave her from the
postman,” explained Jan, and she and her
brother ran faster than before toward their
mother.</p>

<p>“Oh, children!” cried Mrs. Martin as Ted
and Jan drew near, Tom having gone back
home the way he came, through the hedge,
“have you seen Baby William?”</p>

<p>“Seen Trouble?” asked Ted, laughing.</p>

<p>“Yes, only I wish you wouldn’t call him
that name when he’s lost!”</p>

<p>“Lost?” cried Ted and Jan in a chorus
like twins, only they weren’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>“He must be lost,” went on Mrs. Martin.
“I can’t see him anywhere. Did you go to
him when you went out after having had
your hair combed?”</p>

<p>“No—we didn’t,” and Ted spoke slowly.
“We forgot.”</p>

<p>“Then please go to look for him,” went
on Mrs. Martin. “I saw him playing in the
yard near the hammock, but he may have
crawled through the hedge. I’ll come after
you as soon as I answer the telephone which
is ringing. Hurry, and find William!”</p>

<p>“We will!” answered Ted. “Come on,
Jan!”</p>

<p>Jan and Ted hurried around to the rear
yard of their house to look for Trouble.
That, really, was what Baby William was
called more often than anything else.
Daddy Martin called him a “bunch of trouble,”
while Mother Martin always put
“dear” before the name. To Ted and Jan
their little brother was just plain “Trouble”
for he seemed to get into so much mischief.</p>

<p>“Where do you s’pose he is now?” asked
Jan, as she looked here and there in the
yard.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s in the chicken coop,” replied
Ted. “He hid there once and came out all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
covered with feathers, like a rooster.”</p>

<p>But Trouble was not there. Though an
old hen that flew cackling off her nest probably
thought the two children made trouble
enough for her, getting her all in a flutter
just when she wanted to lay an egg.</p>

<p>“Look in the toolhouse,” suggested Ted,
when he and his sister had searched in several
places without finding their little
brother.</p>

<p>Together the two children started toward
a small building where the hoe, rake, shovel
and other garden tools were kept. This was
one of the places where Trouble best liked
to come when he could toddle off by himself.</p>

<p>But Trouble was not in the toolhouse. Ted
and his sister stood looking about the yard
and garden. They were wondering where
next to search, and they were wishing their
mother would come out to help them, when
they heard a sudden laugh. The sound came
from the little brook that ran at the lower
end of the garden.</p>

<p>“There he is!” cried Ted.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope he hasn’t fallen in!” gasped
Jan.</p>

<p>“He couldn’t laugh if he had,” declared
Ted. “His mouth would be full of water.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>“Oh, Trouble would laugh no matter what
happened,” returned Jan. “Come on—let’s
find him!”</p>

<p>The two Curlytops parted the currant
bushes that grew on the edge of the small
brook. Then they saw Trouble.</p>

<p>Their little brother was standing in mud
and water over his knees, holding out a
bunch of watercress to a brindle cow that
stood in the brook, reaching out her tongue
for the bunch of green.</p>

<p>“Oh, Trouble!” cried Jan. “Oh, Trouble!”</p>

<p>“My! what a sight you are!” exclaimed
Ted. “Maybe mother won’t give it to you
for getting all muddy! What you doin’?”</p>

<p>“Feedin’ posy-tree to bossy-cow!” gurgled
Trouble. He called any bunch of weeds,
flowers or grass a “posy-tree.”</p>

<p>“Come right here to me this minute!” ordered
Jan, as she had heard her mother
call. “Come here, Trouble!”</p>

<p>“Trouble can’t! Trouble got to feed posy-tree
to bossy-cow.”</p>

<p>“I guess he’s stuck in the mud,” remarked
Ted. “That mud’s awful sticky. I’ve been
in it. Trouble is stuck in the mud all right!”</p>

<small>A CRASH IN THE KITCHEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment Jan and Ted stood looking
at their little brother, fast in the mud, while
Trouble, laughing and gurgling, held out the
green watercress “posy-tree” to the cow.</p>

<p>“Oh, how will we ever get him out?” questioned
Jan. “Mother will be so worried!
What shall we do, Teddy?”</p>

<p>“I’ll wade in and get him.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll get all mud too!”</p>

<p>“I’ll take off my shoes and stockings,”
and the boy began to do this.</p>

<p>There came a laugh from Trouble.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter now?” asked Jan,
who had been looking to see if she could not
find a board with which to make a little
bridge over the mud so she could reach her
baby brother without getting her feet wet.
“What did you do, Trouble?” asked Jan.</p>

<p>“Bossy-cow frow water on Trouble.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Make Trouble all wet!” and he laughed
joyously.</p>

<p>“Oh, look!” gasped Jan.</p>

<p>Ted, who by this time had taken off his
shoes and stockings and rolled up his knickerbockers,
looked and cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s soaking wet! He might just as
well have gone in swimming!”</p>

<p>Trouble was certainly wet. The cow, in
stamping her front legs to get rid of some
biting flies, had splashed water from the
brook over the little boy standing in front
of her, still holding out the “posy-tree” of
watercress. Trouble was splattered from
his head to his waist, which was all of him
that was out of the brook, his fat, chubby
legs, far past his knees, now being sunk deep
in the water and mud of the brook.</p>

<p>“Get him out quick!” ordered Jan. “The
cow might bite him!”</p>

<p>“Cows don’t bite,” declared Ted. “I’m
not scared.”</p>

<p>“Well, get him out anyhow,” went on Jan.
“Oh, Trouble!”</p>

<p>Ted waded in, and, putting his arms
around Trouble, pulled out his baby brother,
who tossed the greens to the cow. Then,
laughing and kicking, thus splashing mud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
and water on Ted, Trouble was dragged to
dry ground and hurried into the house.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Trouble!” cried Mother
Martin, who was just coming out to look for
him, “you are such a sight! As if there
wasn’t trouble enough without this!”</p>

<p>“Is there more trouble, Mother?” asked
Jan, while the maid, Nora, carried off the
wiggling little fellow to wash him.</p>

<p>“Yes, there is more trouble,” said Mrs.
Martin slowly, while Nora was putting some
clean clothes on Baby William. The children’s
mother still held in her hand the letter
Jan had taken to her from the postman.
“There is much more trouble.”</p>

<p>“What about?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“It’s about Cherry Farm.”</p>

<p>“You mean grandpa’s—where we’re going
for our vacation?” inquired Jan, looking at
her mother with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes. But I don’t know whether or not
we’re going there for the vacation days.
That’s the other trouble, children.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. Ted and
Jan, looking with wondering eyes at one
another, felt as if, for them, the bottom had
somehow or other dropped out of the world.</p>

<p>From the bathroom could be heard the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
giggles and squeals of Trouble as Nora was
combing his hair. It was not as curly as the
tousled wigs of his brother and sister. To
Ted and Jan, at that minute, the baby’s
cries seemed the only real thing in the house.</p>

<p>Not to go to Cherry Farm for their vacation!
Could such a thing happen? They
just stared at their mother and then at the
letter still in her hand.</p>

<p>“Can’t we—can’t we <i>ever</i> go to grandpa’s?”
asked Jan slowly.</p>

<p>“Then where can we go on our vacation?”
Ted questioned, before his mother had a
chance to answer his sister.</p>

<p>To the Curlytops Cherry Farm meant a
great deal. Ever since they could remember
they had heard it talked of at home, and
more than once they had gone there for visits,
sometimes in winter and again in summer.
Grandpa was Daddy Martin’s father,
and Cherry Farm was the nicest place in the
whole world, so the Curlytops thought.</p>

<p>There was a big white house. There were
red barns, broad, green fields, shady trees,
horses, cows, sheep, a little brook, a lake—oh,
so many delightful things! And now——</p>

<p>“Why can’t we go to Cherry Farm?”
asked Jan again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“Because there may not be a Cherry Farm
any more,” answered Mother Martin, and
her voice was sad.</p>

<p>“Did—did somebody take it?” asked Ted,
and yet he did not quite see how anyone
could pick up a big farm and walk off with
it, especially when it had on it houses and
barns to hold it down, as teacher used to put
a weight on the papers of her desk to keep
the wind from scattering them about the
room.</p>

<p>“Somebody may take it,” said Mother
Martin. “It’s too much for you little folks
to understand. However, I’ll tell you about
it as well as I can. But here comes daddy.
Wait until after supper, then we’ll talk.”</p>

<p>“Hello, everybody!” cried Daddy Martin,
coming into the room and catching up first
Jan and then Ted. “Where’s Trouble?”
and he looked around for Baby William.</p>

<p>“Oh, Trouble had—trouble,” said his wife
with a smile. “He waded in the mud of the
brook. Nora is cleaning him now.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Little Trouble in a brook,</div>
<div class="verse">Nora cleans him with a—washrag!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Daddy Martin laughed as he made up this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
little verse. Then came a patter of bare feet
in the room, and a joyous cry.</p>

<p>“Ah, here’s my bunch of Trouble!” exclaimed
Mr. Martin as he caught up the little
fellow who, now all sweet and clean, ran
crowing and laughing into his father’s
arms.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess all the trouble is over
now,” said Daddy Martin, as he tossed
William toward the ceiling, being careful, of
course, not to bump it, which might have
made the plaster fall down. Oh, yes, and
it might have hurt Trouble too. I almost
forgot that part.</p>

<p>“There’s more trouble,” said Jan, as her
father sat down in the easy chair to wait
for Nora to say that supper was on the
table.</p>

<p>“More trouble? I hope our old rooster
hasn’t caught cold! We must send for the
doctor at once!”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t that,” answered Ted, laughing,
for his father was always making some
joke about the rooster catching cold.</p>

<p>“What is it then?”</p>

<p>“Grandpa is going to lose Cherry Farm!”</p>

<p>Jan gave a gasp as Ted said this.</p>

<p>“Lose Cherry Farm!” cried Daddy Martin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
as he looked over at his wife in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, there is bad news,” she said. “But
maybe it will turn out all right in the end,
as Nora would say. I’ll tell you after supper.
There’s the bell.”</p>

<p>And while the family is at table I will tell
you just a little about them, so you will feel
that you have been properly introduced. I
did not have time to do it before, on account
of so much happening—Trouble getting
stuck in the mud and all that.</p>

<p>I have told you why Ted and Jan were
called Curlytops, so you know that much
about them, anyhow. And you have really
met all the family, from daddy and mother,
down to Trouble and Nora, with Ted and
Jan coming in between, you might say.</p>

<p>The Martins lived in the town of Cresco
in an Eastern State, and Mr. Martin owned
a store. He also owned a nice home just
outside the place.</p>

<p>Grandpa Martin, who was Daddy Martin’s
father, lived with Grandma Martin on
Cherry Farm. This was near the country
village of Elmburg, close to Clover Lake.
And, while I am about it, I may as well
tell you that the children had an Uncle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
Frank Barton, who owned a large cattle
ranch near Rockville, Montana. Then there
was Aunt Josephine Miller, a maiden lady
who lived in Clayton and had a summer
place at Mt. Hope near Ruby Lake. She
was a sister of Mrs. Martin’s. The children
always called her Aunt Jo.</p>

<p>Theodore, Teddy or Ted Martin, any of
which names he answered to, was aged seven
and his sister was six years old. The children’s
birth anniversaries came on the same
day, but they had been born a year apart. I
have told you of their curly hair, and I can’t
do more than add that never were such ringlets,
twists, whorls, waves and whatever else
goes to make up curly hair, seen on children
before. Once Grandma Martin’s thimble
was lost and—well, I’ll tell you about that
when we get to it. At any rate “Curlytops”
was the best name in the world for Jan and
Ted, just as Trouble was for Baby William.</p>

<p>I call him a baby, though really he was getting
to be quite a good-sized boy. He was
“half-past two years growing on three,” as
Jan always said whenever anyone asked his
age, and he was bright and quick.</p>

<p>“Well, now let’s hear about the trouble,”
said Daddy Martin, as, having finished his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
supper, he pushed back his chair from the
table, and took his little boy up in his lap.</p>

<p>“I gived posy-tree to bossy-cow, an’ bossy
sneezed an’ I got wet-muddy,” said William,
reaching up to kiss his father.</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard about what happened to
you, Trouble,” said Mr. Martin, pretending
to bite off one of the baby’s ears as a sort
of dessert after his meal. “But what is
worrying you, Mother?” and he looked over
at his wife.</p>

<p>“There is trouble at Cherry Farm.”</p>

<p>“What kind of trouble?”</p>

<p>“High water has spoiled the wheat, your
father has lost money, and now he may lose
the farm.”</p>

<p>Mr. Martin gave a long whistle.</p>

<p>“That <i>is</i> bad,” he said. “Who told you
about it?”</p>

<p>“A letter came this afternoon. It was
from Grandmother Martin. Here it is.”</p>

<p>Jan and Ted watched their father as he
read what the postman had left. Then Mr.
and Mrs. Martin talked together in low
voices.</p>

<p>Jan and Ted did not know what it was all
about, but they heard enough to tell them
that it was real trouble. Something had happened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
to grandpa’s farm, he had lost much
money, and unless he paid some men more
money to get rid of some queer thing called
a “mortgage,” he might have to move away
from Cherry Farm.</p>

<p>And that, Jan and Ted knew, would be
dreadful. Dreadful not only for them, for
they would have no place to spend the long
vacation, but bad also for grandpa and for
Grandma Martin. For Cherry Farm was
their home.</p>

<p>“However,” said Daddy Martin after a
bit, “it may not be so bad as it seems now.
I’ll see what I can do.”</p>

<p>Ted and Jan felt better. When Daddy
Martin talked this way something good was
always sure to happen. It always had, and
it always would, they were sure. Daddy
Martin could do almost everything.</p>

<p>“Do you think we can go to Cherry
Farm?” asked Ted anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I think so,” answered his father
slowly. “Even if trouble comes it will not
get here right away. You’ll have the summer
there anyhow.”</p>

<p>“And cherries?” asked Jan, who was very
fond of them.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Grandma writes that they’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
have a bigger crop of cherries than ever before.
They weren’t hurt by the high water
that flooded and spoiled the wheat.</p>

<p>“And now I think I’ll write grandpa a
letter,” went on Daddy Martin. “I’ll tell
him I’ll help all I can, and——”</p>

<p>“So will we!” chimed in Jan and Ted,
while Trouble gurgled:</p>

<p>“Me help too!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess you will—help eat cherries
and get sick!” laughed Jan, throwing her
arms about him.</p>

<p>“Maybe grandpa won’t want us all to go
out there for the summer,” said Mother
Martin. “If he has to save his pennies——”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’ll be plenty to eat—there always
is at Cherry Farm,” said her husband;
“and that’s all the children want. The old
house is big enough for us all, and more.
We’ll go surely enough. It wouldn’t seem
right if we didn’t. Summer would not be
summer without Cherry Farm.”</p>

<p>Jan and Ted thought so too.</p>

<p>Daddy Martin had set Trouble on the
floor, to go away to write his letter. Mrs.
Martin was talking to Nora about the work,
while the Curlytops drew their chairs to the
table, now cleared of dishes, and began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
talk of what they would do in the country.</p>

<p>“Maybe we can pick cherries and sell
’em,” said Ted.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” agreed Jan. “If we had a little
cart and a pony——”</p>

<p>“Oh, that would be great!” cried her
brother. “I could drive and you could dish
out the cherries! Let’s write a letter to
grandpa and ask him——”</p>

<p>Just then, before Ted could finish what he
was saying, there came a crashing sound
from the kitchen. A look around showed
that Trouble had slipped away. The reason
for the crash was consequently explained—at
least, in part.</p>

<p>“Oh, Nora, what is it?” called Mrs. Martin
who had just gone upstairs.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothin’ much, Ma’am,” was the answer.
“It’ll be all right, I guess.”</p>

<p>“But, Nora! What <i>was</i> it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothin’; only William pulled a big
pan full of milk over on himself. I was
goin’ to make junket of it, but now Turnover
is lappin’ it up. It’s all right; she
hadn’t had her supper yet, and the milk’ll
do her good.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>AT CHERRY FARM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted</span> and Jan rushed to the kitchen. In the
middle of the floor, in the center of a pool
of milk that flowed all about him like a little
lake, sat Trouble, a look of surprise on his
chubby face. Near him was a pan that had
held the milk. It had bounced right side up
after having been pulled from the table, and
a little milk had remained in it. This milk
a maltese cat was now lapping up.</p>

<p>“Oh, Trouble!” cried Ted.</p>

<p>“And you spilled the nice milk!” added
Jan. “And you’re all wet again! Oh, Trouble
Martin!”</p>

<p>“He’s wet, sure enough,” said Nora, who
did not seem at all angry at the mess in her
kitchen. “There was nigh two quarts of
milk in the pan. I was goin’ to make it into
junket, but the baby got ahead of me.” She
laughed. Nora could laugh easily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“Oh, my dear Trouble!” cried Mother
Martin. “How did it happen?”</p>

<p>“He just got hold of the table oilcloth and
pulled on it when I wasn’t lookin’,” explained
Nora. “The pan of milk came with
it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Trouble!” said Mrs. Martin with a
sigh, “when will you ever learn not to pull
things?”</p>

<p>“Trouble all wet—bossy-cow splash water—bossy-cow
give milk,” said William, rubbing
the white fluid out of his eyes.</p>

<p>“He means a cow was to blame for every
bit of his trouble to-day,” explained Nora.
“He was in trouble with a cow in the brook,
and now here. But it’ll be all right. I’ve
got more milk for junket, and Turnover is
enjoyin’ herself.”</p>

<p>Turnover was the children’s cat. She had
learned the trick of lying down on her back
and rolling over when told to do so. Generally
she did that trick to get something
to eat.</p>

<p>“Oh, Turnover!” gasped Jan, “what a fine
supper you’re having!”</p>

<p>And then the cat, thinking she had been
told to do her trick, rolled right over in the
pool of milk on the kitchen floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“I ’ike Turnover,” gurgled William, as he
clasped the now dripping and bedraggled
pet in his arms, making himself wetter than
ever.</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad when this day is over!”
sighed Mrs. Martin, but she could not help
laughing at the funny picture Trouble
made.</p>

<p>His mother carried the baby off to put him
to bed; Nora set the pan out of the way,
where the cat could finish her supper in
peace; and then the maid started to mop the
floor.</p>

<p>“I’ll make more junket after William’s
asleep,” said Nora to Jan and Ted.</p>

<p>They were very fond of milk made thick
and sweet in this way, and Trouble too always
ate his share of junket.</p>

<p>The day on which so many things had happened
came to an end at last. Trouble was
in bed and asleep. So were Jan and Ted.
Mother and Father Martin sat up a little
later than usual, talking.</p>

<p>“Then you think, after all, we can go to
Cherry Farm?” asked Mother Martin.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. We’ll go. Maybe there’ll be
some way out of the trouble. I want the
children to have a happy summer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“Well, they surely will if they spend their
vacation on Cherry Farm.”</p>

<p>And, though neither Mother nor Father
Martin knew it, the Curlytops were also
going to do more than just have fun.</p>

<p>“What are you goin’ to do, Teddy?” asked
Jan the next morning after breakfast, as she
saw her brother out in the yard with a
shovel.</p>

<p>“Huh? Who dropped a ‘g’ letter that
time?” asked Ted with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t mean to,” responded
Janet. “I was wondering what you were going
to do with the shovel.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to dig a hole,” and Ted was
very particular to put his g on the ends of
words this time, though he forgot oftener
than did his sister.</p>

<p>“A hole! What for?” asked Janet. “Are
you going to plant something, as grandpa
does at Cherry Farm?”</p>

<p>“Nope. I’m just going to dig a big hole
and see how deep I can make it. Then it
won’t seem so long waiting until it’s time to
go to grandpa’s.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Let me help?” begged Jan. “I
love to dig!”</p>

<p>“I’ll let you shovel away the dirt I dig,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
promised her brother. “But don’t let Trouble
see us.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because he might fall down the hole, and
if I make it deep maybe we couldn’t get
him out.”</p>

<p>“Nora took him to the store with her,”
answered Janet. “He won’t bother us for
awhile.”</p>

<p>“All right. Then we’ll dig.”</p>

<p>Part of the Martin yard was the children’s
playground, where they were allowed to do
about as they pleased. Ted was fond of digging
in the sandy soil, and he often made
forts, tunnels and cities in the earth, Jan
helping in this play.</p>

<p>Picking out a spot where the soil was soft,
Ted began to dig.</p>

<p>“You poke the dirt away when I shovel it
up,” Ted ordered his sister, for though she
sometimes told him what to do, like a “little
mother” when it came to anything like this
Ted was the “boss.”</p>

<p>It was not hard digging, and Ted soon had
a hole deep enough for him to stand in, being
down in it as far as his knees. As he
was shoveling out the dirt, which Janet
pushed to one side, the iceman came along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“Hello, Curlytop!” he called to Ted.
“What are you doing?”</p>

<p>“Digging a hole.”</p>

<p>“So I see,” and the iceman jingled his
tongs. “Are you going clear through to
China?”</p>

<p>“Where’s China?” asked Jan.</p>

<p>“It’s where the laundryman does daddy’s
shirts,” explained Ted.</p>

<p>“No, I mean the country where the
Chinese laundrymen come from,” went on
the iceman with a laugh. “It’s supposed to
be straight down through this earth on the
other side, you know. So, if you dig deep
enough, you may come to China,” and he
passed on.</p>

<p>“I’m going to do it,” said Ted after a bit,
during which time he had dug so deep that
only his shoulders were out of the ground.</p>

<p>“Do what?” asked his sister.</p>

<p>“Dig to China. And when I get the hole
all the way through I’ll take you with me.”</p>

<p>“I—I guess I don’t want to come,” said
Janet slowly.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>She thought for a minute while Ted
looked at her over the edge of the hole.</p>

<p>“’Cause what are you going to stand on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
when you get all the way through the hole
to China? There won’t be anything there
and you’ll fall. I don’t want to fall.”</p>

<p>Teddy thought this over a minute and
then said:</p>

<p>“Well, maybe I won’t go all the way to
China. I forgot about falling through. But
I’ll dig a deep hole anyhow.”</p>

<p>And he did—so deep that at last Jan had
to stand on the very edge of it and look
down in it before she could see her brother.</p>

<p>“Don’t go down any farther,” she begged.
“You maybe can’t get out again.”</p>

<p>“Yes I can,” declared Ted. “You get the
little ladder we play light street-lamps with,
an’ I can climb out.”</p>

<p>This ladder was a side from an old wooden
crib that Trouble no longer slept in, and
Ted and Jan often used it in their games.</p>

<p>When Jan brought this and put it down in
the hole, Ted could easily climb out.</p>

<p>“I guess I won’t dig any more now,” he
said. “I’ll cover up the hole with some
boards, and maybe to-morrow I’ll go
deeper.”</p>

<p>Jan helped her brother put some pieces of
wood over the hole and then she went off to
play with her doll while Ted found Tom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
Taylor, and the two boys played marbles in
the shade.</p>

<p>That night, just as the Curlytops were
going to bed, there was a queer howling in
the yard.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked their mother.</p>

<p>“It sounds like Skyrocket,” said Daddy
Martin.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is our dog!” cried Ted. “Something
has bit him.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he has bit some person, or maybe
a cat,” said his father. “I’ll go and see
what it is.”</p>

<p>The Curlytops waited anxiously until
their father came back. When he did he was
laughing, and he carried Skyrocket in his
arms.</p>

<p>“I found him down in a big hole in the
yard,” said Mr. Martin. “Poor Skyrocket
couldn’t get up. He had fallen through the
boards that were over the hole. I wonder
how it got there?”</p>

<p>“I was going to dig through to China,”
explained Ted, “but I didn’t finish. Is Skyrocket
hurt?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Daddy Martin. “But I
guess he was pretty badly scared. Don’t dig
such deep holes any more, Teddy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>Ted promised he would not, and after he
and his sister had petted their dog they went
to bed.</p>

<p>A few days later everything was ready
for the start to Grandpa Martin’s home in
the country. Ted and Jan, dressed and
ready to start for the railroad station, were
out on the front porch taking care of
Trouble.</p>

<p>“Well, well! you look very spruce this
morning!” called the postman as he passed
the house. “Where are you going, Curlytop—you
and your brother and sister all dressed
up so stylish?” and he patted Ted’s hair,
which seemed more tangled than ever.</p>

<p>“We’re going to grandpa’s Cherry
Farm,” Ted answered.</p>

<p>“Save me some cherries,” begged the postman.
“I love ’em, but nobody ever sends
me any in the letters I deliver.”</p>

<p>“I guess they’d squash and the juice
would run all over if they did,” laughed
Jan.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” agreed the postman. “Well,
good-bye, Curlytops, and Trouble too! I
hope you have a good time!”</p>

<p>“Good-bye!” they called to him.</p>

<p>A little while after this they were in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
train and on the way to Elmburg. Many of
the passengers in the car looked more than
once at the curly, tousled heads of Jan and
Ted, and one woman remarked:</p>

<p>“Did you ever see such wonderful hair?”</p>

<p>“It must be a task to comb it,” said another.</p>

<p>“No wonder the conductor called them
what he did as he passed through,” said the
first woman.</p>

<p>“What was it?” asked the second.</p>

<p>“He named them the ‘Curlytops.’ But I
suppose they’re used to that by this time. I
never saw such tight curls!”</p>

<p>Nothing much happened on the trip, except
that Trouble wanted a number of drinks
of water. Ted or Jan brought them to him
in cute, little, white paper cups, and Baby
William thought they were fine to play with,
after he had emptied them.</p>

<p>“P’ease, Teddy, det me a dwink,” Trouble
begged for about the eighth time. “I’s
fwirsty!”</p>

<p>So Ted brought the paper cup full of
water.</p>

<p>“Dat’s dood! bring me annuver!” demanded
Trouble, as soon as he had drained
the last drop, and piled the cup up with others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
on the window-sill. “I ’ikes water!”</p>

<p>“Better look out or you’ll have to swim to
grandpa’s if you drink much more,” laughed
Daddy Martin.</p>

<p>Then Mother Martin took Baby William
on her lap and talked to him, telling him a
little story that sent him to Slumberland,
thus giving Ted and Jan a rest from going
up and down the car aisle after drinks of
water for their little brother.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the train reached the village,
and there was Grandpa Martin smiling
and looking eagerly at each coach to get the
first glimpse of his loved ones.</p>

<p>“Well, well! Here you are! Here you
are!” he cried as he saw them. “Right over
this way is the team! Pile in! Pile in!”</p>

<p>The patient horses stood waiting. The
big wagon held the whole family, trunks and
all. Jan and Ted looked curiously at their
grandfather at first, as if to see whether his
trouble had changed him any. But if he was
worrying, he did not show it, and the two
Curlytops breathed easier.</p>

<p>“Is the farm there all right?” Jan could
not help asking, as grandpa turned the
horses down the shady road.</p>

<p>“All there—what the high water didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
wash away,” he answered with a laugh, and
hearing this the children felt better.</p>

<p>“And how is Trouble?” asked grandpa,
looking at the baby. “Did he cut up any
coming down?”</p>

<p>“No, he was pretty good,” laughed the
baby’s mother, and then she and daddy and
grandpa talked, while Jan and Ted looked at
houses and other things along the road, trying
to remember what they had seen on their
last visit to the country.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s the house!” cried Ted as the
horses trotted around a turn in the highway.</p>

<p>“And there’s grandma waving to us!”
added Jan. “Oh, I’m so happy!”</p>

<p>“Bless your hearts!” cried grandma, as
she kissed them all, snuggling her withered
cheeks—like well-kept apples—down on the
chubby face of Baby Trouble. “Bless your
hearts—every one!”</p>

<p>“You dot any bossy-cows?” Trouble demanded
when everyone had seen everyone
else, and it was quiet for a minute in the
old farmhouse. “I want a bossy-cow.”</p>

<p>“What does he mean?” asked grandma.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess he’s thinking of the time he
gave some watercress to a cow that was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
our brook,” explained Ted, telling how
Trouble had been stuck in the mud.</p>

<p>“Bossy-cow splashed milk on me,” went
on Trouble. “I like milk.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want you taking any more
baths in it,” laughed his mother. “You
may go out and play with him,” she added
to the two Curlytops. “Be careful he
doesn’t get into mischief!”</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Jan. “We’ll go outside
and have some fun, Trouble!”</p>

<p>“Trouble!” exclaimed Grandma Martin.
“What a name for a dear, sweet little baby!”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s a dear, sweet, little bunch
of trouble—sometimes,” laughed Daddy
Martin.</p>

<p>“We see bossy-cow?” asked William, as
he took hold of his sister’s hand on one side,
and Ted’s on the other.</p>

<p>“Yes, if we can find one,” promised Jan.
“Come on!”</p>

<p>Trouble was very willing to go. He toddled
along down the side path out toward
the barn. Some chickens, in their wire-fenced
yard where they were kept so they
could not scratch the garden, cackled at the
children, and an old rooster crowed.</p>

<p>“Dat our roosterfer?” asked William,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
making the name a little longer than it
needed to be.</p>

<p>“No, that isn’t our roosterfer,” laughed
Jan. “It’s one just like ours, though. Oh,
Trouble, you mustn’t throw a stick at the
nice rooster!” she cried, for her little brother
had let go of her hand and had tossed a stick
over into the chicken yard, making the fowls
scatter about with many a surprised cluck.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Trouble?” asked
Ted.</p>

<p>“Make roosterfer crow see if he got cold
like our roosterfer,” was the answer.
“Trouble want hear roosterfer crow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind about the roosterfer,”
beguiled Jan. “Let’s go to see the bossy-cows.”</p>

<p>This was what William wanted, so away
he toddled, leaving the chickens in peace.
The children went out to the barn, where
some of the horses, which the men were not
using at different places on the farm, were
eating hay or grain in their stalls. Ted and
Jan always liked to look at the horses.
Sometimes one would put its head over the
lower half of the closed stall door and look
at the little boy and girl, letting them rub
its velvety nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>While Jan and Ted were doing this of
course they could not keep hold of Trouble’s
hands, nor did they watch him very closely.
So, when they looked for him a little later,
they did not see their small brother.</p>

<p>“Oh, where can he have gone?” gasped
Janet. “And mother told us to be so careful
in watching him!”</p>

<p>“He can’t be very far off,” answered Ted.
“He was here a little while ago. Come on,
we’ll look!”</p>

<p>They went out of the barn, one of the
horses calling, or whinnying, after them.
The door had been left open when they went
into the barn, and of course Trouble could
have gone out that way.</p>

<p>But when Jan and Ted looked around the
barn, near the corncrib, up past the smoke-house
and in near-by hiding places, where
they, themselves, often hid, they did not find
Trouble.</p>

<p>“Oh, where can he be?” said Jan again
and again.</p>

<p>“We’ll find him!” Ted declared.</p>

<p>But this time Trouble seemed to have hidden
himself very carefully. Nor did he answer
to the calls Jan and Ted gave. They
did not want to call their father or mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
for they were not yet quite ready to give
up and admit that they, themselves, could
not find their little brother.</p>

<p>“Let’s look down in the lane,” said Ted
after a bit.</p>

<p>This lane was a long, grassy one between
two big meadows, and was a sort of driveway
leading to a far-off part of Cherry
Farm. Other farmers besides Grandpa
Martin sometimes used it, though it belonged
to him and came to an end near his
barns.</p>

<p>So down the lane went Jan and Ted, calling
for their little brother. They walked
on a little way and then stopped to listen.</p>

<p>“Hark!” called Ted suddenly, when his
sister had finished her last cry for the missing
child.</p>

<p>From behind some bushes a little way
ahead of them came a baby voice saying:</p>

<p>“I found de bossy-cow! I found de bossy-cow!
But he’s a ’ittle bit one. Such a ’ittle
bit!”</p>

<p>“There’s Trouble!” cried Jan joyously.</p>

<p>“Yes. But I wonder what he has,” said
Ted.</p>

<p>They ran ahead, and there, behind the
bush, they saw Baby William sitting on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
ground and holding to the horns of a big
goat that was standing in front of Trouble,
looking at him as though in great surprise.</p>

<p>“Why Trouble Martin! What <i>are</i> you doing?”
cried Jan. “Come away from that
goat this minute! He may hook you!”</p>

<p>“Dis a bossy-cow!” Trouble murmured,
holding with one hand to the long horns of
the animal and with the other stroking the
chin whiskers. “Nice bossy-cow!”</p>

<p>“It’s a goat!” cried Ted, walking toward
the child and wondering if the goat would
butt him if he lifted Trouble out of the
way.</p>

<p>“Dis a bossy-cow!” insisted Trouble.
“Bossy-cow got horns. Dis got horns. Dis
bossy-cow!”</p>

<p>“Get up off the ground,” ordered Jan.
“How did you get there?”</p>

<p>“Nice bossy-cow push me down here,”
said Trouble.</p>

<p>“I think the goat must have butted him
a little,” said Ted. “But the goat is a gentle
one, I guess. He didn’t hurt Trouble. Get
up!” he said. “Come here, Trouble.”</p>

<p>“No! Can’t.”</p>

<p>“You can’t come! Why not?” asked Ted
in surprise. “Why can’t you come away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
from the goat—I mean bossy-cow, Trouble?”</p>

<p>“’Cause Trouble am a hen now. Trouble
goin’ to sit on hen’s nest and watch for ’ittle
chickens. De bossy-cow he push me in
chickie’s nest an’ I goin’ to be hen! I dess
I didn’t break <i>all</i> de eggs!” He moved a
little to one side, still keeping hold of the
goat’s horn, and showed Ted and Jan that
he was, indeed, sitting in the midst of the
whites and yellows of the broken eggs of a
hen’s nest which had been made under the
bush.</p>

<p>“Oh my!” gasped Ted. “He <i>is</i> right in
with the eggs! Oh, what a mess he’ll be!
Oh, Trouble!”</p>

<p>“Such trouble!” echoed Jan.</p>

<p>“Dat me. I’s Trouble!” cheerfully observed
Baby William. “An’ I’s dot a bossy-cow!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>THE GOAT WAGON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Curlytops</span> stood and looked at their
little brother. That was all they could do
for a few seconds. It all seemed so very
queer and funny. There sat Trouble right
in the middle of the hen’s nest, and he had
sat down so hard, or rather, the goat had
pushed him down so quickly, that many of
the eggs were broken.</p>

<p>“I’s a chickie—dat’s what I is,” said
Trouble. “An’ I dot a bossy-cow. He’s all
mine—I ketched him. He was jumpin’ over
de grass like a grasshopper an’ I ketched
him. I got him now!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he has got him,” remarked Ted.
“It’s a fine goat, too. I wonder whose
he is?”</p>

<p>“Dis a bossy-cow, an’ I ketched him,” said
Trouble again. “I’s a hen, too, an’ I’s goin’
to have ’ittle chickies!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“Chickens can’t come out of broken eggs—anyhow
not till after the hen sits on ’em
and the chickens break the shells themselves,”
explained Jan. “I saw a chickie
break out of the shell once. But, oh, Trouble!
you are such a sight! What will mother
say, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“She like de bossy-cow,” answered the
little fellow.</p>

<p>“It isn’t a cow. That’s a goat,” said Ted.
“And it’s a wonder he didn’t butt you and
hurt you.”</p>

<p>“I guess he’s tame,” remarked Jan. “He
looks like a nice goat.”</p>

<p>Ted went up to the animal Trouble was
holding by the horns and patted it. The goat
made a soft bleating sound, like a sheep, and
seemed to like being rubbed.</p>

<p>“He <i>is</i> a nice goat,” went on Ted. “I
wish we could keep him.”</p>

<p>“He’s mine,” announced Trouble. “He’s
a ’ittle bossy-cow, isn’t him?”</p>

<p>“Well, you can call him that,” laughed
Jan. “Let go of him, Trouble, and let’s see
if he’ll run away.”</p>

<p>Baby William let his chubby hands slip
from the goat’s horns, and the animal backed
away a few steps but did not leave the place.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
Instead he came close to Ted and rubbed his
little black nose on the boy’s hand.</p>

<p>“He likes you,” said Jan. “Oh, wouldn’t
it be great if we could keep him for our
own, and hitch him to a pony cart, Ted?”</p>

<p>“A pony cart would be too big. It would
have to be a goat cart.”</p>

<p>“I’s got a go-cart at home. We can put
de ’ittle goat-bossy-cow in dat an’ div him a
wide,” put in Trouble in his own peculiar
language.</p>

<p>“Brother Ted means a <i>goat</i> cart—not a
baby-carriage <i>go</i>-cart,” explained Jan.
“Oh, Trouble, wouldn’t it be nice if we could
keep the goat?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Him’s my goat,” said Trouble, but
he was more interested just then in himself.
He had pulled himself to his feet by taking
hold of some of the branches of the bush over
his head, and now he turned half around to
look at the seat of his little bloomers.</p>

<p>“Oh, Trouble!” cried Ted, laughing, “you
look just like a fried egg!”</p>

<p>“Or an omelet!” added Jan. “What shall
we do with him?”</p>

<p>Ted did not know. Nearly always when
his little brother fell in the mud, or got
dirty from playing in the yard, his mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
or Nora took charge of him. Neither of
them was at hand how. What could be
done?</p>

<p>“We could let him ride home on the goat,”
said Ted, scratching his head as he had seen
his father do when he was trying to think.</p>

<p>“Oh! are you going to take him home—to
grandpa’s?” asked Jan.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to. Can’t leave him here.
He’s got to be washed and dressed and——”</p>

<p>“I was talking about the goat,” laughed
Jan.</p>

<p>“Oh! I meant Trouble. But we’ll take
the goat home, too. He may belong to somebody
else, but maybe we can keep him a little
while and have some fun. Wonder what his
name is?”</p>

<p>“Bossy,” said Trouble. “Him’s a bossy!”</p>

<p>“No; that’s a cow’s name, and this is a
goat,” explained Jan. “We’ll have to think
up a name for him. But, oh, Trouble! how
are we <i>ever</i> going to get you clean? Those
eggs are so messy!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I meant by letting him ride
the goat,” went on Ted. “Most of the
whites and yallers would come off on the
goat.”</p>

<p>“Then we’d have to wash it,” said Jan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“That would be easy,” declared Ted.
“All we’d have to do would be to let him
swim in the brook.”</p>

<p>“Dere’s a brook over here,” said Trouble,
waving his hand to show where he meant.
“I frowed stones in it, an’ den I found de
bossy-cow-goat. I wash myse’f in de
brook.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Jan. “Maybe we can
wash off some of the egg before mother sees
him, Ted. She’ll blame us for not keeping
watch of him.”</p>

<p>“He ran out of the barn before I saw
him,” said Teddy. “Well, come on, let’s go
to the water. Wait, though. I don’t want
this goat to get away. I’ll tie a piece of
string to his horns and lead him along with
us.”</p>

<p>Ted found a piece of thin cord among the
many things in his pockets, and fastened a
bit to the horns of the goat. If the animal
had not wanted to go along with the children
the string would not have pulled him, for it
could have easily been broken. However the
goat seemed to have taken a liking to the
Curlytops, and it followed Jan and Ted as
they led their little brother toward the
brook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>It was not far from where Trouble had
sat down in the hen’s nest, and then, tying
the goat to an old stump near by, Ted and
Jan started to clean Baby William’s bloomers
of the egg stains. They stood him on
the edge of the brook, and by using bunches
of grass for wash cloths they got off some of
the sticky whites and yellows. Trouble was
kept quiet while this was going on by being
allowed to pet the goat which came and stood
near him.</p>

<p>“Him’s a nice goat,” said Trouble, and
Ted and Jan thought the same thing.</p>

<p>Jan was scrubbing rather hard with a
bunch of grass at a very eggy-yellow spot on
one leg of Trouble’s bloomers when, all of a
sudden, the little fellow slid backwards, and
before his brother or sister could catch him
he sat down “splash!” in the shallow water
of the brook.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” gasped Ted, almost slipping
into the stream himself, he was so surprised.</p>

<p>“Oh, Trouble!” murmured Jan. “Oh,
dear!”</p>

<p>“Dere! Now ’ook what you did!” said
Trouble himself, never offering to get up.
“You pushed me in! But I get nice an’
clean <i>now</i>!” and he smiled joyously, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
water was warm and Trouble always liked
to have his bath, more than once jumping
into the tub before all his clothes were off.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess you will get nice and clean,”
laughed Ted. “Don’t you care, Jan,” he
said to his sister. “This is the best way to
wash off those eggs. Come on, Trouble, get
up, and we’ll squeeze as much water out of
you as we can. Then we’ll take you home.”</p>

<p>“Will you wide me on de bossy-goat?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll ride you on the goat if he’ll
let you stay on his back.”</p>

<p>Jan and Ted wrung as much water as
they could from Trouble’s bloomers. They
were very wet, but falling into the brook
had taken out most of the egg stains. Then
the little chap was lifted to the back of the
goat. The animal did not mind in the least.</p>

<p>“He’s been ridden like this before,” decided
Ted. “And I guess he’s been hitched
to a wagon, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if we only could do that!” sighed
Jan. “It would be such fun!”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can,” her brother told her as
he held Trouble on the goat’s back with one
hand and guided the animal with another
hand on one horn. Jan did the same on the
other side.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“Where can we get a wagon?” Janet
asked.</p>

<p>“Make one,” said her brother. “There’s
lots of old wood around grandpa’s barn.
Wait till we get home.”</p>

<p>On the way, riding on the goat’s back,
Trouble told how he had slipped out of the
barn and how, after throwing stones in the
brook, he had seen what he thought was a
“’ittle bossy-cow.” He had taken the goat
by the horns. This the animal, being very
gentle, let him do without offering to butt
him. Then Trouble led the goat along until,
half by accident and half in playfulness, the
goat had shoved Baby William backward
into the nest of the hen that had stolen away
from the chicken yard to lay her eggs under
the bush.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear children! what in the world
have you been doing?” cried Mother Martin
as she saw the little procession come down
the path toward the house. “Where have
you been?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother! Trouble found a goat, and
we’re going to keep him!” cried Ted.</p>

<p>“’Ittle bossy-goat,” put in Trouble.</p>

<p>“And he sat down in a hen’s nest, but we
washed him off!” added Jan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“Who, the goat or Trouble?” asked
Daddy Martin with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Trouble,” answered Ted. “He was all
whites and yallers, but he’s pretty clean now,
and please may we keep him?”</p>

<p>“Who, Trouble or the goat?” asked
Grandpa Martin.</p>

<p>“Both,” laughed Jan.</p>

<p>“He’s an awful nice goat, and Trouble
just loves him,” went on Teddy.</p>

<p>Then the older children told what had
happened, and Trouble was carried away,
kicking and crying, to have clean, dry
clothes put on him. He wanted to stay and
play with the goat, but Nora promised he
should see his new pet in a little while.</p>

<p>“I think I know whose goat that is,” said
Grandpa Martin, after looking at the animal.
“They moved away and couldn’t take
the goat with them. They left him with
Farmer Emery, but I did hear that Emery
didn’t want him, because Billy was always
wandering off.</p>

<p>“I guess the goat must be lonesome for
children, because the folks that owned him
had half a dozen. They were always riding
or driving him. Emery hasn’t any young
folks on his farm, and the goat has run away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
once or twice. Emery doesn’t care much
about him.”</p>

<p>“Then may we keep him?” begged Ted.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see,” half-promised grandpa.
“If Emery doesn’t want him, and the family
that used to own the goat doesn’t claim him,
I guess we’ve got room for him here. He’s a
good and gentle animal,” went on the old
gentleman to Mrs. Martin, who seemed a bit
worried. “Ted and Jan can manage him
all right.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want them to get hurt,” said
Mother Martin.</p>

<p>“This goat wouldn’t hurt even Trouble,”
declared Ted. “He’s awful nice. Aren’t
you, Nicknack?” he asked, patting the new
pet.</p>

<p>“Nicknack! Is that his name?” asked
Daddy Martin.</p>

<p>“I named him that,” explained Ted. “He
ate so many things when we were riding
Trouble home on his back—grass, weeds,
some paper from an old tin can. It was just
like the nicknack crackers you buy in the
store—all different kinds. So I called him
Nicknack.”</p>

<p>“It’s a nice name,” said Janet. “We call
our goat Nicknack.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“Better wait until you’re sure he’s
yours,” suggested her father.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess they can keep him,” put in
Grandpa Martin.</p>

<p>And he was right. Mr. Emery had no use
for the goat. The family who had left him
could not be found, having moved far away,
and, as Grandpa Martin said, there was
plenty of room at Cherry Farm for the
goat.</p>

<p>“Well, our Curlytops have been here only
one night,” said Mother Martin the next
morning, “and they’ve found a goat. If
they keep this up, by the time we leave
Cherry Farm, we’ll have a regular circus.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, as long as they have a good
time,” returned her husband, smiling.</p>

<p>The children, even Trouble, were out before
breakfast to look at the goat that had
been put in a colt’s box stall for the night.
Nicknack was glad to see his little friends,
and bleated softly as they opened the door of
his new home. One of the farm hands had
given him some hay and oats to eat.</p>

<p>“And now to build the goat wagon,” said
Ted, after breakfast. “May we take some
old boards and wheels if we can find them in
the barn, Grandpa?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>“Yes, take anything you like.”</p>

<p>“I’s going to have a bossy-goat ride!”
laughed Trouble, who, it seemed, did not get
over the idea that the goat was part cow. I
suppose it was because both animals have
horns.</p>

<p>Feeling quite happy now that they were
going to have a real goat for their very own,
and feeling very glad at the chance of having
some rides in a wagon that Nicknack
would pull, Ted, Janet and Trouble started
for the barn.</p>

<p>“Do you really think you can make a
wagon?” asked Janet of her brother.</p>

<p>“Course I can,” he answered. “Didn’t
I make a house, lots of times—a playhouse
that we had fun in?”</p>

<p>“But a wagon is different,” said the little
girl. “A playhouse stays in one place, but
a wagon has to go around and around on its
wheels.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Ted, as if he had thought
it all out long before, “a wagon has to have
wheels on it, and I’m going to put wheels on
this one. Then Nicknack can pull us all
over the farm.”</p>

<p>“Will he pull me, too?” asked Trouble.</p>

<p>“Of course he will,” laughed Janet, giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
her small brother a big hug. “You can have
a nice ride.”</p>

<p>“On his back?” asked Trouble. “Like I
see in pictures!”</p>

<p>“He means those cowboy pictures—like
in the Wild West,” put in Ted.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I don’t guess you could ride <i>that</i>
way, William,” went on Janet. “You might
fall off. It’s lots nicer to ride in the
wagon.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t I ride on Nicknack’s back if
you holded me on?” Trouble wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe. We’ll see,” said Janet,
who did not want to make any promises.
Baby William was always sure to remember
them no matter if everyone else forgot.</p>

<p>“I ’ikes a goat,” murmured the little fellow,
as he walked along beside his brother
and sister. “I ’ikes a goat—much!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Nicknack is a fine goat. I hope
he’ll always live with us,” said Ted.</p>

<p>They were almost at the barn now, when,
all at once, the children heard someone
shouting.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Janet.</p>

<p>“Maybe the barn’s on fire!” cried Ted,
starting to run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“Wait for me!” begged Janet.</p>

<p>“An’ me, too!” added William, for Ted
had let go of his hand as he started off.</p>

<p>The shouting kept up, and the children
could hear one of the men who worked on
the farm calling:</p>

<p>“Look out! Look out! He’s loose! He’s
running away!”</p>

<p>Ted stopped running and looked back at
his sister and little brother.</p>

<p>“Oh, what is it?” asked Janet, her eyes
big with wonder.</p>

<p>“I—I guess maybe the bull has got loose,”
said Teddy. A few days before, a farmer
who lived some miles away from the children’s
grandfather had asked Mr. Martin if
a bull, which the farmer had bought, could
not be kept for a while in the barn on
Cherry Farm. Mr. Martin had said it could
be, and the animal, which was quite wild,
had been shut up in a distant part of the
stable, where he bellowed all day long.</p>

<p>“Oh, if it’s that bad bull,” said Janet,
“we’d better go into the house and stay
there.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s only one of the horses,” said
Teddy, after thinking it over a bit, and
listening to the calls of the man in the barnyard.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
“If it’s only a horse we don’t have
to be scared.”</p>

<p>The truth was that Ted wanted to see
what was going on, even if the bull had gotten
loose, and he did not want to have to
go back to the house with his sister and
Trouble.</p>

<p>“Well, if it’s a horse I’m not afraid,”
said Janet. “Let’s go on.”</p>

<p>“Could I have a ride on a horse?” asked
Trouble.</p>

<p>“Oh, not now!” cried Janet. “He’s running
away, maybe, and he might run away
with you!”</p>

<p>Trouble shook his head. He would not
like that. He took hold of his sister’s hand
on one side, and Ted’s on the other, and
together the three children started on
toward the barn once more. They could
still hear the cries:</p>

<p>“He’s loose! He’s loose! Look out!”</p>

<p>All at once Ted cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s our goat Nicknack! He’s the
one that’s loose! Look at him!”</p>

<p>And, as he pointed, Janet and Trouble
saw the goat running about the barnyard
with a farmhand chasing after him with a
stick. Around and around ran the goat, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
around and around after him ran the man,
calling:</p>

<p>“Whoa! Whoa there, nice goat! Don’t
run away!”</p>

<p>But the goat was running away, and he
didn’t “whoa” when the man told him to.</p>

<p>“You stay here,” directed Ted to his sister
and little brother.</p>

<p>“What you going to do?” asked Janet.</p>

<p>“I’m going to help catch that goat,” answered
Teddy.</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe he’ll butt you!” exclaimed
Janet.</p>

<p>“No, he won’t do that,” went on Ted.
“That goat knows me, and he don’t know
that man. That’s why he’s scared, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Is the man scared?” asked Janet, as she
saw him chasing around after the goat.</p>

<p>“No, but I guess Nicknack is,” answered
Teddy. “I’ve got to help catch him so he
won’t be scared. You stay here with Trouble,”
and he led his sister and Baby William
to a place near a corner of the barnyard
fence where he thought nothing could hurt
them.</p>

<p>“I wants to come wif you!” begged
Trouble, as Teddy started off.</p>

<p>“No, you stay with sister and I’ll give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
you a nice ride in the goat wagon when
brother makes it,” promised Janet.</p>

<p>“I wants a wide now,” said Trouble, as
he watched the goat running, “I ’ikes to
wide fast.”</p>

<p>“Not as fast as that, I guess,” replied
Teddy, with a laugh, for Nicknack was fairly
flying around the barnyard. “You’d fall
off, Trouble, and bump your nose.”</p>

<p>Baby William didn’t want anything like
that to happen, so he did not again ask to
ride on the goat.</p>

<p>The farmhand kept on chasing Nicknack,
calling him to stop, but the goat would not.
Then, as Ted came near, and opened the
gate of the yard around the barn, to go in,
Nicknack saw what was going on.</p>

<p>Suddenly the goat made a dash for the
open gate.</p>

<p>“Look out! He’s coming! He’ll try to
get loose, and if he gets out maybe you’ll
never catch him again!” cried the hired
man.</p>

<p>Ted tried to close the gate, but he was not
quick enough. Right past him ran the goat,
knocking the little boy down, but not hurting
him, I’m glad to say.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted Ted as he struck the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
ground. His breath seemed to be knocked
out of him, as it once was when he was
struck by a football.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ted! are you hurt?” cried Janet,
who saw what had happened.</p>

<p>“No. I’m all right,” he answered.</p>

<p>The hired man, who ran out of the gate
after the goat, stopped to pick up Teddy
and brush some of the dirt off his clothes.</p>

<p>“I never did see such a goat!” cried the
man. “Look at him go!”</p>

<p>The goat had run out of the barnyard
now, jumped over a low fence and was running
down the road.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Ted. “We’ve got to
get him! What made him run out of the
stall?”</p>

<p>“I did; but I didn’t mean to,” explained
the man. “I was taking him some more
water, for he seemed very thirsty, when I
stumbled and dropped the pail. The water
splashed all over him, and he got scared, I
guess. He gave his head a yank, broke the
strap and ran out.</p>

<p>“I ran after him, but I couldn’t catch
him. Then you opened the gate, and there
he goes!”</p>

<p>“But we’ve got to get him!” cried Ted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
who was all right again after being knocked
down by Nicknack. “We’ve got to get him.
Come on!”</p>

<p>He and the hired man ran down the road
after the goat. They were glad to see, a
little distance down, that Nicknack had now
stopped and was nibbling the grass.</p>

<p>“Now we can get him,” declared Ted.</p>

<p>“You’d better go up to him yourself,”
said the hired man. “He might be mad at
me, thinking I spilled that water on him
purposely. You go up to him, and I’ll stay
back.”</p>

<p>So Teddy, holding out his hand, walked
toward Nicknack, calling gently:</p>

<p>“Come here, Nicknack! Come here, nice
goat!”</p>

<p>The goat stopped nibbling the grass and
looked up. He seemed to know Ted, and
did not run any farther. The hired man hid
behind a tree so the goat would not see him.</p>

<p>Slowly Ted walked toward his new pet.
Still Nicknack did not run, and he let the
small boy take hold of the broken strap by
which Nicknack had been tied in the stall.</p>

<p>“Now he’s all right,” Teddy said as he
led the goat along the road and back into
the barnyard. Nicknack did not try to run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
any more. He really had been frightened
when the water was spilled, and all he
thought of was running away. But he
seemed to know that Ted would be kind to
him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad you got him back,” said
Janet as she walked to meet her brother.</p>

<p>“Where’s Trouble?” asked Ted, as he
looked for Baby William.</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot all about him!” exclaimed
Janet. “There he goes!” and she pointed
to him, walking toward a little brook that
ran across one end of the barnyard.</p>

<p>“Catch him ’fore he wades in and gets his
feet wet!” cried Ted, as he led Nicknack on.</p>

<p>Janet ran after her little brother, whom
she had let stray away while she watched
Ted go after the goat, and caught Baby
William just in time. He was about to
paddle in the water.</p>

<p>Then Nicknack was put back in the stable,
and he seemed glad to be at rest once more.</p>

<p>“Now we can make our cart,” said Ted.</p>

<p>“I think you had better go and put on
your play clothes before you start to make
your cart,” said their mother, who had come
out just at the end of the trouble with the
runaway goat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>This the children did, but were quickly
out at the barn again.</p>

<p>Wearing their old clothes, so that a little
dirt would not hurt, and having promised
not to let Trouble stray away this time, Jan
and Ted started to build the goat wagon.
In the barn were many odds and ends of
boards that Ted felt sure would be just what
he wanted. He knew how to hammer, nail
and saw, for his father had given him a chest
of tools one Christmas. Jan, too, could nail
two boards together, even if some of the
nails did go in crooked.</p>

<p>Ted found part of an old little express
wagon that he had played with a year or two
before while at Cherry Farm. Only two
wheels were left, but one from a broken
wheelbarrow made another for the goat cart,
and for a fourth wheel he found an iron one
that had been on a churn.</p>

<p>The wheels were of three different sizes,
but Ted said he didn’t think that would matter
any.</p>

<p>“It’ll be all the more fun,” declared Jan.
“It’ll be such a funny, wiggily motion when
we ride that it’ll be like sailing in a boat on
dry land.”</p>

<p>“We’ll ride out first and see how fast the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
cherries are getting ripe,” proposed Ted, as
he hammered away at the goat wagon.</p>

<p>“And when they get ripe and are ready to
pick, we’ll help grandpa cart ’em in and sell
’em. Then maybe he’ll have lots of money
and won’t have to lose the farm,” said Jan.</p>

<p>“Do you think he will lose it?” asked her
brother anxiously.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. But I know there’s some
kind of trouble, and grandpa and grandma
are worried. I heard them talking with
mother and daddy quite late last night.
There’s some trouble about Cherry Farm.”</p>

<p>“Yes, here I is. I hasn’t runned away!”
called Baby William.</p>

<p>“Oh, we were talking about another kind
of trouble, not <i>you</i>!” laughed Jan as she
hugged and kissed him.</p>

<p>Then she helped Ted make the goat wagon,
while Trouble looked on.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>UPSIDE DOWN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> hammer and saw and nails, with
bits of rope and string, here a piece of tin
and there a board, the goat wagon was finally
built. It did not look very spick and span.
Rather it looked like some of the funny
things the circus clowns make when they do
their queer tricks in the ring.</p>

<p>But there were four wheels, even if they
were of different sizes, to the wagon Jan and
Ted had made, and there was a seat for
them, with room in between for Trouble.
And, as Jan said, the uneven wheels gave the
wagon such a queer, wobbly motion that it
was ever so much more fun riding in that
than in a regular store wagon.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’ll get a new wagon after we
learn to drive the goat,” said Jan, as she
watched Trouble combing out Nicknack’s
whiskers with a pine-cone he had picked up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“Maybe,” assented Ted.</p>

<p>“I like the way this wagon rides. It’s
part like a swing and the other part is like
a seesaw,” observed Jan, when Ted, pulling
the cart himself, had given her a ride about
the front yard, to see how the wagon rode before
they hitched the goat to it.</p>

<p>“It will do until we get a new one,” her
brother agreed.</p>

<p>“How are you going to hitch Nicknack to
it?” Jan suddenly demanded.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can make a harness. There’s lots
of old straps in the barn.”</p>

<p>“But what about a bit? And reins?
Haven’t you got to have an iron bit for Nicknack’s
mouth, like grandpa has for his
horses?”</p>

<p>“I think I can put a strap around his nose,
with reins on each side of it. I saw a camel
harnessed that way in the circus,” answered
Ted. “I don’t like to put a bit in a goat’s
mouth.”</p>

<p>Ted had been told by his grandfather that
a goat’s mouth is not hard like a horse’s.</p>

<p>“Maybe a strap would be better,” agreed
Jan.</p>

<p>And while Trouble sat in the rebuilt
wagon and pretended to drive Nicknack with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
a string tied to the goat’s horns, Jan and
her brother patched together a sort of harness.
Grandpa and Daddy Martin helped
them some, but the children could easily tell
that something was wrong at Cherry Farm.
Never before, in all their visits, had they seen
the faces of Grandpa Martin and Grandma
Martin so sad, and the two men did not talk
and laugh as they used to do.</p>

<p>But the Curlytops did not think long about
this sadness, for they were too eager to have
fun; though they would have done anything
in the world, if they could, to help their own
dear daddy and their mother, and, of course,
grandpa and grandma.</p>

<p>“Just wait until the cherries are ripe,”
said Ted, as he put the finishing touches to
the harness. “Then we’ll help pick them
and cart them to market. As soon as we
hitch up Nicknack we’ll go over to the cherry
grove and see how big the green ones are.”</p>

<p>The goat seemed very willing to be hitched
to the queer wagon Jan and Ted had made
from odds and ends. True, it might not be
like the smart cart and real harness he was
used to, but Nicknack was a good goat, and
he did not mind pretending that this queer
rig was just the finest ever made. At least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
he might have made-believe, if goats ever do
such things, of which I am not quite sure.</p>

<p>“All aboard now!” called Ted one afternoon,
when the wagon and harness were
ready. “All aboard!”</p>

<p>“Anybody would think this was a boat!”
laughed Jan, as she led Trouble down off
the back steps, ready for a ride.</p>

<p>“Well, it does wobble like one,” laughed
Ted. “You wait and see! That’s why I
called ‘All aboard!’ Come on. Get in!”</p>

<p>“Me goin’ to drive!” shouted Trouble.</p>

<p>“No, not at first,” answered his brother.
“I’ll have to wait and see how Nicknack behaves.
I’ll let you drive after a bit.”</p>

<p>“Then me holler ‘giddap!’” insisted Baby
William, who was eager to do something.</p>

<p>“Yes, you may make Nicknack giddap,”
agreed Jan, lifting him into the wagon.</p>

<p>Mother and Grandma Martin, as well as
Nora, who had come to the farm, too, came
out to see the children start off.</p>

<p>“How cute they look,” said grandma.</p>

<p>“Yes. I hope nothing happens—that that
queer contraption holds together,” remarked
Mother Martin.</p>

<p>“Well, if anything does happen I have a
nice picture of them,” put in Nora, who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
a little camera. She had “snapped” the trio
as they started off in the wagon drawn by
Nicknack. “It’ll come out lovely, I think.”</p>

<p>Along the shady, grassy lane Ted drove
Nicknack. The lane led to the cherry grove
where hundreds of trees had been in blossom.</p>

<p>Now the blossoms had fallen off, and in
place of each one was a little round green
ball, that, when the sun had warmed it and
the rain had wet it, would turn into a beautiful,
big black or red cherry. Grandpa
Martin’s cherries were known all around
Elmburg, and even on the other side of
Clover Lake, as the best in that part of the
country.</p>

<p>“And maybe we can ride to Clover Lake
after we go to the cherry grove,” said Jan,
as they jogged along the lane where the yellow
dandelions looked like spots of gold in
the green, velvet grass.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” assented her brother. “I don’t
know whether Nicknack is afraid of water
or not.”</p>

<p>“He wasn’t the day Trouble sat down in
it after he broke the eggs,” laughed Jan.
“Besides, this wagon is so like a boat that
maybe it will float on the lake.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“Maybe!” agreed Ted.</p>

<p>It surely was a queer cart, with two hind
wheels alike, but with two different sizes for
the front ones. As it rolled along first the
left front end would rise up and then the
right would do the same. If one had stood
back of them and looked at the two Curlytops,
with Trouble seated between his
brother and his sister, one would have
thought them on the back of a camel or an
elephant. That was the way the goat cart
swayed, up and down and sidewise.</p>

<p>But the wheels stayed on, which was more
than Ted’s father and grandfather had
dared to hope at first. And the harness,
though much patched and made from many
bits of straps and ropes, stayed on the back
of Nicknack. So that the goat pulled the
cart along after a fashion.</p>

<p>“And he guides good, too,” said Ted, as
he pulled first on the left-hand cord and then
on the right. “See how easy it is, Jan.”</p>

<p>A sort of muzzle of straps had been put
around Nicknack’s nose, and on either side
of it was a long cord. The cords were the
reins, Ted not having been able to find light
leather straps that were long enough. But
the cord-reins did very well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>“Yes, he does guide nice,” agreed Jan,
for when she pulled on the left cord Nicknack
turned that way, and when she pulled
on the right cord he went that way.</p>

<p>“Me want to drive de bossy-goat!” insisted
Trouble, and they let him pull gently
first on one cord and then on the other. He
laughed and kicked his heels against the bottom
of the cart when he found the goat would
turn aside for him.</p>

<p>“Don’t kick too hard, Trouble,” said Ted,
as his little brother kept up the drumming
with his heels on the cart floor.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Jan. “He’s got his
old shoes on. It won’t hurt them.”</p>

<p>“No, but it may hurt the cart,” replied
Ted. “This bottom isn’t very strong, and it
may drop out all of a sudden.”</p>

<p>“If it does, won’t we drop too?” asked
Jan.</p>

<p>“Yes. That’s why I don’t want Trouble
to kick so hard.”</p>

<p>“But he wants to kick,” said Trouble.</p>

<p>Janet looked over the side of the little
wagon to see how far they would have to fall
in case the bottom did drop out, but seeing
soft grass all around her she concluded they
would not be hurt if they did have such an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
accident. Nevertheless, she held Trouble’s
feet so he could not kick.</p>

<p>At first he wiggled, trying to get them
loose; and to quiet him Jan reached over
and pulled some long dandelion stems.
Snipping off the yellow flower, she blew
through the hollow stem, making a little
noise as though she had blown a tin trumpet.</p>

<p>“Here, Trouble,” she said to her baby
brother, “blow the dandelion horn.”</p>

<p>He puffed out his red cheeks and blew,
making a tiny squeak which so delighted him
that he forgot all about kicking the bottom
out of the goat wagon.</p>

<p>On and on rode the Curlytops along the
lane, on one side of which were pastured
some cows that came and hung their heads
over the fence, chewing their cud as they
looked at the goat drawing the wagon. On
the other side of the lane were some sheep,
and some of them ran along the fence, as
though they would like to get out and go
with Nicknack and the children.</p>

<p>At last they came to the cherry grove.
They rode along under the hundreds of trees,
and on many were some quite large green
balls, up among the leaves. On other trees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
were smaller ones. These green balls would
turn into ripe cherries a little later.</p>

<p>“Grandpa is going to have a lot of them,”
said Ted, as he guided Nicknack under the
bending branches. “Maybe the cherries will
make him rich if he does lose his farm.”</p>

<p>And, though Ted did not know it, the cherries
were to have a large share in clearing
away the troubles of Grandpa Martin.</p>

<p>“I’s hungry!” suddenly announced Baby
William, after they had been riding some
time in the cherry grove.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s eat,” suggested Jan. “I’ve
got the lunch.”</p>

<p>“Lunch!” cried Ted. “I didn’t know
you brought any lunch!”</p>

<p>“Yes, grandma put some up for us in a
little basket when you were harnessing Nicknack.”</p>

<p>“Goody!” roared Trouble.</p>

<p>And, oh, how good that lunch tasted!
There were slices of bread and butter with
just enough jam on, and no more. There
were sugar cookies with just enough sugar
sprinkled over the top, and not a grain too
much. There were crisp brown crullers, just
brown enough and not a smitch more, I do
assure you!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>Even Trouble had enough, and when he
was hungry he was very, very hungry, like
the little girl with her forehead on her curl,
or the curl on her forehead, I forget which.
So you can easily know that Grandma Martin’s
lunch was just fine.</p>

<p>“Now we must go back,” said Ted, after
a bit. “Mother told us not to stay too long.
And, besides, Jimmie Dell is coming over to
play ball with me to-day.”</p>

<p>“And Mary Seaton said she’d come over
and we’re going to have a play-party for our
dolls,” added Jan. “So I ’spect we’d better
go back.”</p>

<p>Jimmie and Mary were two children who
lived not far from Cherry Farm, and who,
on other visits, had played with Jan and
Ted.</p>

<p>So the Curlytops started back in the goat
wagon with Trouble. They left the cherry
grove, trying to remember how it looked, so
they could tell grandpa the good news about
the fine crop he would have, and they turned
into the grassy lane again.</p>

<p>Now the lane was down hill going home,
and this made Nicknack run rather fast. It
was so easy pulling the wagon down the
slope, you see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“Whoa, there! Whoa!” cried Ted once
or twice. “Don’t go so fast!”</p>

<p>For when the goat ran fast the queer
wagon wobbled more than ever on its uneven
wheels, and Jan had to hold tightly to
Trouble so he would not slip out.</p>

<p>But Nicknack was like some horses. He
went faster toward his stable than away
from it. Besides, he was hungry. For
though the children had given him bits of
cake and bread, still he wanted hay and
oats.</p>

<p>So Nicknack ran rather fast on his way
home through the grassy lane, and some old
sheep who saw him went:</p>

<p>“Baa-a-a-a-a! Baa-a-a-a-a!”</p>

<p>It was as if they, too, were calling:</p>

<p>“Whoa!”</p>

<p>But Nicknack did not stop. On and on
he went faster and faster, and Ted pulled
as hard as he could on the cord-reins, for he
knew that was how grandpa stopped the
farm horses when they ran too fast.</p>

<p>And then something happened. Two or
three things happened, to tell you the truth.</p>

<p>Ted pulled so hard on one cord-rein that it
broke. This yanked the goat’s head around
sharply to the left and he almost ran into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
the fence. Then one of the front wheels
came off and, before Jan or Ted could do
anything to stop it, the goat wagon turned
upside down, throwing them out.</p>

<p>Then the harness broke, and Nicknack
pulled himself completely away from the
cart, though he did not mean to. But when
he found he was free, he looked at the upset
wagon and then began to nibble the grass
at the side of the lane.</p>

<p>Ted and Jan picked themselves up off the
soft ground. They had not been in the least
hurt, and both were ready to laugh. That is,
they were after a first look at the upside-down
wagon. But when they glanced
around a second time and could not see Baby
William anywhere, they did not feel so much
like laughing. They were a little bit frightened.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>THE LITTLE LAME BOY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Where’s</span> Trouble?” asked Jan, as she
got up and brushed some dried grass out of
her hair, for her head had bumped the
ground.</p>

<p>“Yes, where <i>is</i> Trouble?” added her
brother, and he looked up in the air, as
though he might see Baby William floating
around like a circus balloon when it gets
loose. If Trouble had been like a rubber ball
he might have bounced up in the air. But
he was not in sight as Ted looked up.</p>

<p>“Where, oh, where, can Trouble be?”
asked Jan again.</p>

<p>And then came a little, faint cry, as though
far off.</p>

<p>“Was that Nicknack bleating?” asked
Ted.</p>

<p>“It didn’t sound like him,” answered
Jan. “What did you do with our little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
brother?” she asked of the goat, who said
never a word, but kept on eating grass. The
noise sounded again.</p>

<p>“Maybe it was a sheep,” suggested Ted.</p>

<p>But the sheep were far away, at the other
end of the pasture, so it could not have been
they. Then the cry sounded once more.</p>

<p>“I want to get out! I want to get out!
Oh! Oh!”</p>

<p>“It’s Trouble!” shouted Jan.</p>

<p>“But where?” Ted asked.</p>

<p>Without answering, Jan hurried to the
overturned wagon. As she lifted up one side
of it there came a cry from underneath.</p>

<p>“I want to go home! I want my
mamma!”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Trouble!” gasped Ted. “He
was under the wagon!”</p>

<p>And so he was. When Nicknack turned to
one side so quickly, and when one of the
wheels came off, upsetting the goat cart, Ted
and Jan had been tossed out, or else they had
jumped, they hardly knew which. But
Trouble had stayed in, and consequently the
wagon had fallen right over on top of him,
hiding him underneath it.</p>

<p>Luckily the sides of the wagon were high,
and as there were soft cushions in it and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
piece of carpet, little Trouble was not in the
least hurt. His head was not even bumped,
but, of course, he was frightened, for he was
in the dark, and he thought he was shut in a
closet at home, which he never liked. He did
not know it was only the overturned goat
wagon which held him down.</p>

<p>Trouble stopped crying as soon as Jan and
Ted lifted the wagon so he could crawl out,
which he did immediately. Then he saw
Nicknack eating grass at the side of the lane
and he laughed.</p>

<p>“Bossy-goat runned away!” cried
Trouble. “Didn’t him?”</p>

<p>“That’s what he did!” answered Ted.
“But he didn’t mean to. Only our wagon is
busted!”</p>

<p>It was—well, not “busted,” but broken.
One wheel had come apart. Being an old
and a dry one, the spokes had fallen out.</p>

<p>The harness had broken, too, and it was
useless to try to hitch Nicknack to the little
wagon again. In fact, cart, as well as harness
would have fallen in pieces.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to mend it,” decided Ted.
“We’ll leave it here and drive Nicknack
home without the cart. I wish we could get
a new one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“Let’s ask daddy or mother,” suggested
Jan. “They know now that our goat is good
and that we can drive him. Maybe they’ll
let us have a better cart.”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t think we could drive
Nicknack if they saw what just happened,”
laughingly declared Ted. “But we couldn’t
help it.”</p>

<p>Having brushed the grass and dirt off
Trouble, the Curlytops, their fuzzy hair
rather ruffled by their fall, started home
through the lane. Ted mended the broken
reins, and carried a cushion under one
arm, while Jan took the others and led
Trouble.</p>

<p>Baby William wanted to ride the goat
home, with a cushion for a saddle, but Ted
was afraid the animal, having found what
fun it was to upset a cart (though really he
did not mean to do so) might take a notion
to toss Trouble off his back. So there was
no riding for the rest of that day. They
were soon at grandpa’s house.</p>

<p>“Why, The-o-dore Baradale Mar-tin!”
cried his mother, using the little boy’s whole
name, which usually was too large to be said
all at once. “What has happened and where
is the goat wagon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“Oh, it’s smashed! It was too old, anyhow!”</p>

<p>“Nicknack threw us out, but we’re not
hurt,” added Jan.</p>

<p>“An’ I was hidin’ under de wagon an’ dey
touldn’t found me!” laughed Trouble, for it
was all a joke to him now.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear! Is he hurt?” asked the
mother of the Curlytops, picking up her
“dear bunch of trouble.”</p>

<p>“Nope,” answered Jan. “He liked it.
Didn’t you, Trouble?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Only it was dark under de wagon.
I’s hungry!”</p>

<p>“Bless your little tummy-tummy!”
laughed Mother Martin, rolling Trouble up
into a ball, and pretending to toss him high
in the air. “You shall have some milk.
But what happened, Ted?”</p>

<p>Taking turns, with Trouble now and then
getting in a word “edgewise,” as Nora said,
Ted and Jan told the story of their first goat
ride.</p>

<p>“And, oh, grandpa! such a lot of cherries
as you’ll have!” cried Jan, as they spoke of
the cherry grove. “There’ll be millions an’
millions of ’em!”</p>

<p>“Can’t you sell them and get rich so you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
won’t have to lose the farm?” asked Ted,
as his grandfather came in to hear the story
of the ride and the upset.</p>

<p>“Well, I can sell some of the cherries, yes.
But too many of them are almost as bad as
not enough.”</p>

<p>“Why?” Ted wanted to know. He could
not understand that.</p>

<p>“Because if there are too many cherries
they don’t bring a good price in the market.
Maybe, even, I can’t sell them all, and they’ll
spoil,” grandpa explained.</p>

<p>“We’ll help eat ’em,” promised Jan.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess between you and the birds
you’ll get rid of some. But don’t you Curlytops
worry about the farm. You are here
to have vacation fun, and I want you to enjoy
every minute, though it’s good of you
to look after my cherries,” and Grandpa
Martin caught Trouble up in his arms to
kiss him.</p>

<p>“And can we help pick some and bring
them in with our goat wagon?” asked Ted.
“Oh, I forgot! The wagon is broken. I
guess we’ll have to get a lot of new wheels
and—and—things.”</p>

<p>“Or a new wagon,” added Jan. “Can’t
we have one, Daddy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“I’ll see about it,” promised her father.</p>

<p>The Curlytops tried to mend the broken
wagon, but it was too badly smashed. Ted
bruised his fingers with the hammer, and
Jan ran a sliver in her thumb “tinkering”
over the broken wheels and things, but they
could make nothing that would be safe for
Nicknack to pull.</p>

<p>“I know what we can do,” said Ted to his
sister one day.</p>

<p>“You mean to have fun?”</p>

<p>“I mean to get a goat wagon. Let’s go
down to the blacksmith shop and see if the
blacksmith man hasn’t got some old wheels
or something.”</p>

<p>Ted did not know exactly what he wanted.
But he had often passed the blacksmith shop,
which was on the road from Cherry Farm
to the village, and had seen many parts of
wagons inside and outside the place.</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll go with you,” agreed
Janet.</p>

<p>Together the children went down the
shady road to the blacksmith shop. On the
way they stopped to gather flowers, and
Janet’s nose was all yellow from the buttercups
and dandelions she smelled. The
smith was pounding a red-hot horseshoe on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
the anvil, his hammer striking out glowing
sparks.</p>

<p>“Hello, Curlytop!” he called to Ted,
whom he had often seen going past in Grandpa
Martin’s wagon. And once Ted had been
in the shop when one of the farm horses was
shod. “Hello, Curlytop! Did you come to
help me work? I’ve got lots to do. Just
bring me that big hammer!” and he laughed
as he pointed to the heavy sledge that took
all a big man’s strength to swing.</p>

<p>Ted tried to lift it, but he could not even
drag it across the blacksmith shop floor.</p>

<p>“Guess you’ll have to eat some more
crusts of bread before you are strong enough
to lift that!” laughed a man in the shop.</p>

<p>“Do bread crusts make you strong?”
asked Jan.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve heard say they make your hair
curl,” went on the man; “and you two tots
must have eaten loaves that were all crust,
by the looks of you!” and he laughed again.</p>

<p>“I like bread crusts,” said Ted. “I’ll eat
a lot if they’ll make me strong.”</p>

<p>“They’ll help some,” said the blacksmith.
“But what can I do for you to-day, Curlytop?
Did you bring your horse to be shod,
or do you want a bit for your goat?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>Then Ted and Jan, by turns, told of wanting
something to fix their broken wagon.
The blacksmith said he was sorry, but he had
nothing, since he mended only big farm wagons
or carriages much too large for Nicknack.
He had no old wheels or anything that
would do, he said.</p>

<p>Ted and Jan stood watching the smith fit
a shoe to a horse tied in the shop. Suddenly
a fly bit the animal and it gave such a jump
that Mr. Decker, the smith, had to let go the
leg of the horse and jump back to avoid being
stepped on.</p>

<p>“Whoa there!” he called to the frightened
horse. “Whoa! Steady!”</p>

<p>Jan and Ted started to run out, but Teddy
tripped over a piece of iron on the floor and
the next he knew he had sat down backwards
in the low tub of water in which the smith
cooled the red-hot pieces of iron.</p>

<p>“Oh—oh!” gasped Ted, flinging up his
arms and wiggling his feet, trying to save
himself from falling all the way in.</p>

<p>“Oh, The-o-dore Martin!” cried Jan, as
she sometimes heard her mother say it.
“You’re all wet!”</p>

<p>“Huh! I guess I know it,” Teddy announced,
as he got out of the tub with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
help of one of the men in the shop, while
the smith quieted the horse.</p>

<p>“Yes, you <i>are</i> a bit wet,” said Mr. Decker.
“But I filled the tub with clean water only
last week, so you won’t be very dirty. Here,
you can stand near the forge fire and dry out.
You’ve got on dark pants and the dirt won’t
show.”</p>

<p>Only the seat of Teddy’s knickerbockers
were really wet, and though the water ran
down his legs he did not much mind. He
stood near the warm fire until he was nearly
dry, and so hot he could no longer stand it,
and then he and Jan went home.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a mercy you weren’t burned
on the red-hot horseshoe,” said Mother Martin,
when she heard what had happened.
“Why did you go there?”</p>

<p>“We wanted a goat wagon,” replied Jan.</p>

<p>“Daddy, I guess you’ll have to get them
one to keep them out of mischief,” said the
mother of the Curlytops.</p>

<p>“I’ll see what I can do,” promised Grandpa
Martin.</p>

<p>“Has anyone seen my thimble?” asked
Grandma Martin after supper that night,
when they were in the sitting-room. “I
know I had it on when I was talking to you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
Jan, as you stood near me a little while
ago.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s in my hair, Grandma,” said
the little girl.</p>

<p>“In your hair, child? What do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, you patted me on the head you
know, and maybe the thimble stuck in.
Mother’s ring came off her finger in Teddy’s
hair once, and we couldn’t find it for a long
time. Look in my hair,” and she bent her
head down close to grandma’s spectacles.</p>

<p>“Why! There it <i>is</i>!” cried Grandma
Martin with a surprised laugh, as she ran
her fingers through Janet’s hair and discovered
the missing thimble. It was caught in
a tangle of curls just as it had been pulled
off grandma’s finger.</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho!” laughed Grandpa Martin.
“That’s a good hiding place. I lost a quarter
last year. Come over here, Teddy, and
let me see if it’s in your hair.”</p>

<p>“Why, Grandpa! I’ve washed my hair
since then!”</p>

<p>But grandpa insisted on looking, and, lo
and behold! when he put in his hand, ruffled
up Ted’s hair and drew out his fingers again,
there, between them, was a shining quarter!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>“Oh!” gasped Jan.</p>

<p>“Why—why——” stammered her
brother, in great surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, Grandpa Martin! you just put your
hand in your pocket <i>now</i>, took out a quarter
and had it in your hand when you ruffled up
Ted’s hair!” cried Jan, as she guessed how
the trick was done. “Didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I <i>did</i> lose a quarter last year,” said
grandpa. “I thought maybe it might be in
Ted’s hair, and—well, here it is!”</p>

<p>But grandpa had played that little trick,
as you would have guessed, too, if you had
seen him.</p>

<p>“I wish you could get a goat wagon out
of my hair,” sighed Jan. “We want one
awful bad.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see what I can do,” promised her
grandfather, and a few days later the Curlytops
were told some joyful news.</p>

<p>Asking among the different farmers he
knew, Grandpa Martin heard of one whose
little boy, now grown to be a man, had once
owned a fine goat wagon. It was stored
away in a distant barn, and Daddy Martin
said he would buy it for the Curlytops.</p>

<p>So one day Grandpa Martin hitched the
horses to a big farm wagon, and away he and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
the Curlytops rode, over the hills and far
away, to another farm.</p>

<p>There the goat wagon was found, and it
was a fine one. The wheels were strong and
sound, and, best of all, they were the right
size, so that the wagon did not roll along up
and down and sidewise like a boat on a
stormy mill-pond.</p>

<p>“The wobbly motion of our other wagon
was nice,” said Jan, as she and Ted tried
the new one, “but it made you feel just as if
you had swung in a hammock too long.”</p>

<p>With the wagon also went a real set of
goat harness, and Ted was delighted when
he saw it.</p>

<p>“Nicknack can’t break away from the
wagon in this,” he said. “Now we’ll have
some fun! We can cart a lot of cherries in
this wagon for you, Grandpa. You won’t
be poor when cherries are ripe.”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” said the old gentleman, and
he seemed to have to blow his nose very
loudly, though before that he had no cold, as
far as the Curlytops could see.</p>

<p>Nicknack seemed to like his new wagon as
much as did Jan and Ted, and as for Trouble—well,
he just wanted to sleep in it. But, of
course, that could not be allowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“Though you may ride in it as much as
you like,” said his mother.</p>

<p>One day the Curlytops, taking Trouble
with them, set off for a little ride in the new
goat wagon. Grandma Martin stuffed in
many, many cushions, so if anyone fell out
or the cart overturned no one would be hurt.
In spite of the number of pillows, there was
still room for at least five small children.</p>

<p>“If we see anybody who wants a ride we
can give it to them,” explained Ted, as he
saw the extra room in the wagon.</p>

<p>“And we’ve got lots of room to carry our
lunch,” said Jan, who liked to play tea-party.</p>

<p>This time they rode to a new part of
Cherry Farm—or, at least, a part they had
not visited for some time. It was near a
country road, and was mostly used for grazing
horses and cattle.</p>

<p>As the Curlytops drove Nicknack near the
fence, on the other side of which was the
farm of another man, they saw a boy sitting
under a tree. Just then a puff of wind took
off Trouble’s hat and blew it toward this boy.
He looked up as it sailed near him, and with
a stick caught it.</p>

<p>“Hello there!” he cried, on seeing the goat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
cart with the three children in it. “Is this
your hat?”</p>

<p>“It’s Trouble’s, if you please,” answered
Jan.</p>

<p>“Trouble? Do you mean it made a lot of
trouble blowing off? But it isn’t any trouble
for me to bring it to you, though I can’t
come so very fast,” and as he came along the
Curlytops saw that he was a lame boy, and
had to hobble on one foot, dragging the other
after him.</p>

<p>“Hold on! Wait a minute! I’ll come and
get the hat!” cried Ted quickly, as he saw
what the matter was. “Don’t go to all that
trouble.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t any trouble,” was the smiling answer,
and, somehow, Jan liked the way that
lame boy smiled. It was so happy, she said
afterward. “No trouble at all!” he fairly
sang the words.</p>

<p>“Dat’s Trouble’s hat!” piped up Baby
William. “Dat’s mine!”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked the lame boy, pausing,
and then hopping on again.</p>

<p>“Oh, we call the little chap Trouble, just
for a nickname,” explained Ted. “It was
his hat that blew off. Thank you for bringing
it to us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>“You’re welcome—heaps!” said the other,
as he leaned on the fence, after he had
handed over the hat. “Say, that’s a dandy
wagon and goat you’ve got there!” he added,
his eyes shining.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s pretty good,” admitted Ted.
“Like to have a ride?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Please come,” added Jan, in a low voice,
and she tried not to look at his poor, twisted
foot, though she could see it plainly through
the rails of the fence.</p>

<p>“We’s dot lots to eat!” added Trouble,
smiling.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” grinned Ted.</p>

<p>“Then I guess I’ll come,” laughed the
lame boy.</p>

<p>“Do you want me to—I mean—er—that
is, can’t I help you—over the fence, you
know?” asked Ted, speaking rather stammeringly
and awkwardly, for he did not like
to mention the other’s lame foot.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>that</i> doesn’t bother me!” exclaimed
the boy. “I can climb higher fences than
this. Here I come!”</p>

<p>With a spring, a bound, a wiggle and a
climb he was up, over and down, standing
beside the goat, which he began to pat as
though he loved animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“Here, sit on this cushion,” said Jan, in
the same low voice.</p>

<p>She got down from the wagon, taking a
cushion with her. Ted followed, helping
Baby William to the ground. The lame boy
looked at Jan with a warm light in his gray
eyes.</p>

<small>THE FEATHER BED</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Do</span> you live around here?” asked Ted, as
the new boy made himself comfortable on
the cushion which Jan placed on the grass.</p>

<p>“Yes, in that big red place,” and he
pointed across a valley to where, on the side
of a hill, stood a very large house.</p>

<p>“Do you live <i>there</i>?” inquired Ted, in
some envy. He thought it would be great
fun to live in a house that looked large
enough to hold five or six houses as big as
grandpa’s house at Cherry Farm.</p>

<p>“Yes, I live there,” he answered, smiling
again.</p>

<p>“It must be fine!” cried Jan, with sparkling
eyes. “I’d like to live in a place like
that. I mean for a little while,” she added
quickly. “Of course I like our own home
best and there is no place nicer than Cherry
Farm!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“I should think not!” cried the lame boy,
as he looked over the green fields and at the
trees. “I love it here. That’s why I come
over this way every time I can to sit and
look.”</p>

<p>“I should think you’d like it over where
you live,” and Ted pointed to the big red
house across the valley.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it is nice there. But there are
so many of us that sometimes a fellow can’t
be quiet unless he comes away by himself.
It isn’t all of ’em who can, worse luck! I
can travel better than most of ’em. There’s
some who can’t get away at all.”</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Jan curiously.</p>

<p>“The boys and girls.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean your brothers and sisters?”
inquired Ted. “You must have a large family
for such a big house.”</p>

<p>“Family!” cried the lame boy. “Well,
yes,” and he smiled. “I guess you could call
it a family, for we all live in one home. But
they aren’t any of ’em my brothers and sisters.”</p>

<p>“They’re not?” cried Jan. “And yet they
live with you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. You see that’s the Crippled
Children’s Home over there, and I’ve been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
in ’most a year trying to get cured,” and he
looked at his lame foot. “It’s a lot better,”
he went on. “When I first came I couldn’t
walk at all. But now I can come farther
than any of ’em,” and he seemed quite
proud.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad,” said Jan kindly. “Does
it—hurt?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit, except when Dr. Wade pulls
it and twists it to make it bend easier. That
doesn’t hurt but a little while,” and he
smiled bravely. “He’s trying to cure me.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad,” murmured Jan again.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t b’lieve I’d like to be lame,
and not run and jump and climb,” said
Teddy, looking off toward the Home, and
trying not to glance down at Hal’s lame
foot.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t feel sorry for <i>me</i>!” and the
lame boy laughed. “I’m lots better than
some. Why, I can even kick a football with
my ‘bad’ foot as I call it, though there are
lots of others worse. If I had a football
now——”</p>

<p>“There’s Trouble’s,” suggested Jan, looking
at Baby William, who was sitting in the
shadow of the goat cart trying to tickle Nicknack
with blades of grass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“Who is Trouble?” asked the lame boy
curiously.</p>

<p>“He’s our little brother,” explained Ted,
and he told his own name and that of his
sister.</p>

<p>“My name’s Hal Chester,” said the lame
boy, in his turn. “I live in New York.
I was sent to this place to get cured. It
isn’t exactly a hospital, and yet it’s like one.
It’s a Home where lame boys and girls are
cured.”</p>

<p>“Do they cure ’em?” asked Jan softly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Heaps and heaps of ’em.
They’re going to cure me, they say. And
I guess they will, for I’m a lot better than
when I came. If I had a football——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I was going to get Trouble’s,”
interrupted Ted. “He has a little rubber
one he brings with him. We don’t like him
to, as it’s always falling out of the wagon,
and then we’ve got to stop and pick it up.
But he brought it this morning. Hi, Trouble,
where’s the football?” he called to his
little brother.</p>

<p>“I bring it. You play game?” he asked,
for he loved to kick the blown-up ball about.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe a little one,” promised Jan.
“Are you sure it won’t hurt you?” she asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
Hal, as Ted caught the ball Trouble rolled
over to him.</p>

<p>“Sure it won’t. I’m the best kicker in the
Home. Course we don’t play a regular
game, but Dr. Wade said it would be good
for my foot to exercise it, and kicking’s the
best fun I know. I’ll show you!”</p>

<p>He placed the football on a little pile of
dirt, and then, standing on his “good” foot,
he swung the other, which was bent and
twisted, straight at the blown-up ball.</p>

<p>“Plunk!” came the sound, and Trouble’s
ball went sailing through the air.</p>

<p>“Say, that’s a fine kick!” cried Ted. “It’s
great!”</p>

<p>“Ee, dat’s great,” echoed Trouble.</p>

<p>“And it went awful far!” added Jan, as
the ball rolled and bounced away down the
hill.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve done better than that with a regular-sized
ball,” explained Hal Chester.
“Wait, maybe I’ll be able to send it farther
next time,” and he started down the slope
with a half run and a half jump.</p>

<p>“I’ll get it!” cried Ted after him.</p>

<p>“Pooh! Don’t think I can’t run!”
laughed the lame boy over his shoulder. “I
have to wiggle like an eel while I’m doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
it,” he went on, “but I can get there,” and
he did, before Ted reached the ball.</p>

<p>Then Hal sent it flying back with another
kick and Ted, in his turn, lifted it high in the
air and started it rolling about the grass.
Trouble, too, joined in the little game, laughing
and shouting in glee.</p>

<p>“Say, you <i>can</i> kick!” cried Ted admiringly,
as Hal came back to the cushion on
which Jan insisted that he take his seat.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. There’s lots worse things than
being lame. I’m ever so much stronger in
my one good leg than some boys are in their
two. I can stand on it all day and not get
tired. It comes in good when you’re waiting
for the circus parade,” he added with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“I should think you’d want to have two
legs alike,” said Jan.</p>

<p>“I do, and some day I’m going to have, Dr.
Wade says. But I just have to wait, that’s
all,” and he seemed quite cheerful about it.
“No use kicking, you know—unless it’s a
football,” and he smiled at Ted, who smiled
back.</p>

<p>“I didn’t use to have much feeling in my
lame foot,” he went on. “And that was a
good thing, ’cause when anybody stepped on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
my toes it didn’t hurt. But it does now, and
that’s a good sign, Dr. Wade says. Well,
I’ve got to be getting back, they’re calling
me to dinner. I’m glad I saw you,” and he
got up from the cushion.</p>

<p>“Calling you to dinner?” asked Jan. “I
didn’t hear anyone call.”</p>

<p>“It’s that flag over there,” and Hal
pointed to one now waving from a tall pole
in front of the Home. It had not been flying
before, the Curlytops were sure. At any
rate they had not noticed the flag until Hal
spoke.</p>

<p>“That’s a sort of dinner bell,” the lame
boy went on. “Some of the boys and girls
go off in the woods or fields between meals,
or else the nurses take them, and they are
so far off they can’t hear a bell or a horn.
But they can always see the flag, ’cause it’s
so high up, and so when the banner is hoisted
on the pole we know it’s meal-time. So I’ll
be hopping along,” and with a wave of his
hand he started across the field, having
climbed the fence as nimbly as before.</p>

<p>“Will you come here this afternoon?”
asked Ted.</p>

<p>“Maybe. Will you be here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>“And may we come to the Home to see
you sometimes?” asked Jan.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, any time you like. ‘Visitors always
welcome.’ That’s what it says over
the door. We’re going to have a big party
soon, and maybe you can come to that.”</p>

<p>“We’ll come,” promised Jan.</p>

<p>Then, as soon as Hal was lost to sight down
in a little hollow of the green, grassy fields,
the Curlytops talked about him.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t he nice?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered his sister. “And he was
so jolly about his lame foot, he almost
made you think it was fun to have it.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Ted. “And how
he could kick Trouble’s football!”</p>

<p>“Me likes him,” said Baby William. “He
nice boy!”</p>

<p>“Indeed he is!” laughed Jan. “I wonder
what he meant about a party at the Home?”</p>

<p>The Curlytops found out when they got
back to Cherry Farm, for they asked Grandma
Martin.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is a Home for crippled children
that was partly rebuilt and added to
last year,” she said. “It has cured many
lame little ones. I guess what Hal meant
about a party is that they are getting up a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
sort of fair, or entertainment, to raise
money. It needs it since they rebuilt and
made an addition to enlarge the place. All
the folks around here are going to help.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to? Can we help?” asked
Jan eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, father was going to give them a
hundred dollars,” said Grandma Martin
slowly, “but since he had such bad luck and
lost so much I’m afraid he can’t. But I’m
going to bake some cakes so they can sell
them at the fair, and that may help some.”</p>

<p>“I want some cake!” declared Trouble.
“I’s hungry!”</p>

<p>“Then you shall have some bread and
milk,” answered his mother. “You mustn’t
have cake.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how we could help?” asked
Jan of her brother later that day. “I’d like
to raise some money for the Home. We did
once for our Sunday-school by selling lemonade.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we could do that here,” answered
Ted. “We’ll ask Hal this afternoon.”</p>

<p>But Hal, for some reason, did not come
back to the field after dinner, though Jan
and Ted went there in the goat cart.
Trouble had to have his afternoon sleep,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
curling up with his football in his arms, so
he did not go with them.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll ask him to-morrow,” said
Jan, as they drove Nicknack back across the
green grass.</p>

<p>The goat was put in his stable when the
Curlytops got back to Cherry Farm; and
then, as it was egg-gathering time, a chore
with which they always helped, they went
to get Trouble, for he liked to go with them.</p>

<p>“Trouble! oh, Trouble, where are you?”
called Jan, as she came out of her room with
her “chore” clothes on. These garments
were an old dress, stockings and sunbonnet,
for sometimes the hens laid their eggs away
under the barn, and to get them one had to
crawl on hands and knees. “Come and get
the eggs, Trouble!”</p>

<p>“I tan’t tum now!” answered Baby William.</p>

<p>“Can’t come—why not?” asked Jan.
“Where are you?”</p>

<p>“Up de stairs where de softy-softy bed
is.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he means in the spare bedroom,” explained
Grandma Martin, who heard what
Trouble said.</p>

<p>This room was one seldom used. It had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
in it a big feather bed, of the old-fashioned
kind, and Baby William always called it the
“softy-softy,” because he sank away down
in it when his mother sometimes, in fun, laid
him on it.</p>

<p>“I’ll come and get you,” offered Jan.
“You like to come with brother and me after
the chickie eggs, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Me like chickie eggs—me sit in
some!”</p>

<p>“But you mustn’t do it again. Come with
sister now, Trouble, and to-morrow we’ll go
to see Hal kick the football some more.”</p>

<p>“Tan’t tum now—Trouble busy,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll come and see what you’re busy
about,” and with a laugh Jan ran up the
stairs. As she entered the spare room she
gave a gasping cry.</p>

<p>“Oh, Trouble!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Is he hurt?” called
Grandma Martin.</p>

<p>“No, but—oh, Trouble! What <i>have</i> you
done?”</p>

<p>Then Grandma Martin came, and so did
Mother Martin and Ted. They saw Trouble
on the floor, with an edge of the feather bed
pulled down toward him, while he was cutting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
away at the ticking with the scissors,
having made a big hole, while all about
were feathers—feathers—feathers everywhere.</p>

<p>There were feathers on the floor, on the
chairs, scattered over the carpet, and
Trouble himself sat in a heap of them like
some big, queer new bird, with feathers even
in his hair.</p>

<p>“Oh, Trouble!” cried Grandma Martin.
“Why did you cut my nice feather bed?”</p>

<p>“Trouble goin’ to make softy-softy cushion
for lame boy to sit on,” was the baby’s
answer as he went on snipping away with the
scissors, scattering more feathers about the
room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>TOO MANY SHEEP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandma Martin</span> at first did not know
what to say. She just stood looking at
Trouble and at the feathers. She really
could not help seeing the feathers because
there were so many of them and they were
so scattered about the room. Baby William
was almost hidden beneath them.</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” gasped Mother Martin. “I
never knew there were so many feathers in
one bed!”</p>

<p>“Me make cushion for lame boy!” said
Trouble again, and he put his chubby hands
in through the hole he had cut in the ticking,
and pulled out a lot more feathers.</p>

<p>“Make a cushion! I should say you could
make two dozen cushions with the feathers
you’ve pulled out!” said Grandma Martin.
“What does he mean by a cushion for the
lame boy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“Oh, that must be Hal Chester,” explained
Jan. “I gave him a cushion to sit
on this morning, and Trouble saw me. He
said he liked poor, lame Hal.”</p>

<p>“Me do like him—make Hal two cushions!”
declared Trouble, laughing, as he
tossed some feathers up in the air so that
they fell in a shower on his head.</p>

<p>“Oh, Trouble!” sighed Mother Martin.
“Such a mess as you have made! Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” put in Grandma Martin,
soothingly. “We can pick up the feathers,
and I’ll sew them back in the bed. It
doesn’t matter, as no one wants to sleep on
it. Come on, Trouble, we’ll go to get the
eggs.”</p>

<p>“He looks like a chicken himself,”
laughed Jan. “Oh, what a funny, funny
baby!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin caught her baby up in her
arms, and, as she did so, a cloud of feathers
flew all around, and some, getting in Jan’s
nose, made her sneeze.</p>

<p>“Ker-choo!” she went, and Trouble
laughed.</p>

<p>Then he sneezed:</p>

<p>“Ker-choo-choo!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s just like a choo-choo train!” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
laughed, and he tried to sneeze again. But
this time it was the turn of Grandma Martin,
and, as the feathers tickled her nose, and
then Mother Martin’s, they both gave loud
“aker-choos!”</p>

<p>Trouble seemed to think this funnier than
cutting open the feather bed, for he laughed
and clapped his hands in glee. But at last
they got him out of the room and closed the
door so the stuffing of the “softy-softy” bed
would not be scattered all through the house.</p>

<p>Then Jan, Ted and Baby William went to
gather the eggs. They each carried a basket—the
two Curlytops did, but Trouble
was too little they thought. He might drop
his and break the eggs.</p>

<p>“But me <i>want</i> a basket!” he cried. “Me
go after eggs too!”</p>

<p>He made such a fuss about it, and seemed
to be so unhappy because he could not carry
something in which to gather eggs, that
Grandma Martin said, with a smile:</p>

<p>“I’ll make it all right for him.”</p>

<p>She got a little basket, and in it put some
white china eggs, the kind some farmers
leave in hens’ nests to make the chickens believe
they have laid more eggs than really
they have. At least, maybe that is the reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
they leave them there, and maybe it is
for some other reason.</p>

<p>“There are some eggs for you, Trouble,”
his grandmother said. “If he falls and spills
them, or drops them, they won’t break,” she
whispered to Jan and Ted.</p>

<p>This satisfied Baby William, and with the
china eggs in his little basket he set off with
his brother and sister to watch them get the
real eggs out of the nests. And Trouble was
as careful of his china eggs as he could have
been of the sort that would break so easily.</p>

<p>That is, he was as careful as Trouble Martin
could be. Once he dropped the basket,
and the eggs rolled over the ground.
Trouble stood still, while Teddy and Janet
scrambled around and picked them up.
Then, Baby William tipped his basket and
the eggs rolled out. But they were again
picked up, and very soon the little party was
in the chicken yard.</p>

<p>“It will be a little lesson to him,” said
Grandma Martin, “and before very long he
will be big enough to gather real eggs for
himself.”</p>

<p>Jan and Ted soon had their baskets nearly
full. They found most of the eggs in nests
in the hen-house, but now and then some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
queer old “Biddy” of a chicken would slip
out of the chicken yard and go off to lay her
eggs in a secret place.</p>

<p>It was the work of Ted and Jan to find
these places, and they often found them
under the barn. There was one place where
part of the barn wall had fallen away, making
a hole through which a small boy or girl
could crawl. On the ground was hay and
straw that had sifted down from the floor
of the barn above, and this was a favorite
place for hens to make their secret nests.</p>

<p>“I’ll crawl under and see how many eggs
I can find,” said Teddy. “You stay here
and hold my basket, Jan.”</p>

<p>“All right, Ted.”</p>

<p>Under Ted crawled, and pretty soon his
sister heard him call:</p>

<p>“Oh, what a lot of eggs!”</p>

<p>“Did you find many?” Jan asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s a big nest full. I didn’t see
it the last time I came here. I’ll have to
make two or three trips with them.”</p>

<p>Ted crawled back and forth under the
barn, bringing out each time a few eggs to
Jan, who put them in the baskets.</p>

<p>“There’s three more I want to get,” explained
Ted, as he turned to crawl back for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
the fourth time. “They’re away at the far
end.”</p>

<p>Pretty soon Jan heard him call:</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve found another nest!”</p>

<p>“That’s good!” answered his sister.
“Bring ’em out!”</p>

<p>Ted said nothing for a few minutes, but
Jan heard him grunting.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you come out?” she called.
“We’ve got to get dressed for supper. Come
on out with the eggs!”</p>

<p>“I—I can’t,” answered her brother, and
his voice was muffled as though he were down
in a cellar.</p>

<p>“You tan, too,” declared Trouble.</p>

<p>“Why can’t you come?” asked Jan.</p>

<p>“’Cause I’m stuck! I crawled in too far
and now I’m caught under the barn. I can’t
get out!”</p>

<p>For a moment Jan was frightened. She
wondered if Ted would have to stay under
the barn forever. Or would they have to
pull it down to get him out? She remembered
that once a cat had gone in a narrow
space between two houses, not far from
where the Curlytops lived in Cresco, and
the firemen had to come with their axes and
chop away some boards before the poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
pussy, that howled most sadly, could be gotten
out.</p>

<p>“Oh, Teddy!” cried Jan, “what shall I
do? Do you want me to crawl in and pull
you out?”</p>

<p>“No! Don’t you come in!” answered her
brother, his voice sounding farther away
than before. “You might get stuck, too. Go
for grandpa or daddy! Maybe they can get
me!”</p>

<p>“All right,” gasped the little girl.</p>

<p>Away ran Jan, setting down the baskets of
eggs, and telling Trouble not to touch them,
which he promised. But Trouble did something
else. Knowing Ted was under the
barn, and not wanting to be left alone outside,
Baby William started to crawl in after
his brother.</p>

<p>“Me come to git eggs,” he announced, wiggling
along on his stomach.</p>

<p>“Go back! Go back!” cried Ted, who was
not able to turn around. “You’ll be caught,
too!”</p>

<p>“Bear in there catch me?” asked Trouble,
stopping his crawling.</p>

<p>“No, not any bears, of course,” and Ted
could not help laughing. “But you’ll be
caught fast on a nail, or something in your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
clothes, the same way I am. I guess that’s
what’s holding me. Go back, Trouble! Oh,
do go back!”</p>

<p>“No, I come in!” was the answer.
“Trouble goin’ be a ’ittle worm, an’ crawl
under barn. I’s comin’!” And go on he did,
wiggling on his little stomach like a “’ittle
worm,” as he called it.</p>

<p>Ted could do nothing to stop him and
Trouble was soon under the barn near his
brother. Just ahead of them, and out of
reach of Ted’s hands, was a nest with half a
dozen eggs in it.</p>

<p>“Dis nice place,” said Trouble, as he
nestled close beside Ted. “We be chickies
an’ nobody find us here.”</p>

<p>“I wish they would find us,” said Ted.
“This is no fun,” for it was hot and stuffy
under the barn.</p>

<p>Then he heard voices outside near the hole
by which he had crawled in. Grandpa Martin
and Jan were there.</p>

<p>“Oh, where has Trouble gone?” Ted heard
his sister ask.</p>

<p>“He’s in here with me,” replied Ted.</p>

<p>Trouble spoke for himself.</p>

<p>“I am a ’ittle worm, an’ I crawled in here
on my tummy-tummy,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>“Well, I must get them out,” observed
Grandpa Martin.</p>

<p>“Will you have to tear down the barn?
Or maybe send for the firemen?” asked Jan,
thinking of the poor cat.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. If I were smaller I’d crawl
under the barn myself, and pull Ted out by
his heels,” said Grandpa Martin. “I expect
he wiggled under a beam where he is a pretty
tight fit. That happened to me when I was
a boy.</p>

<p>“I’ll go inside the barn, take up a board in
the floor, right over where Ted and Trouble
are lying, and then they can crawl up that
way. Don’t worry, Jan. They’ll be all
right.”</p>

<p>And so they were. When the floor board
was lifted up, right above where Ted lay
stretched on the ground under the barn, he
could get out, and so could the little “worm,”
Trouble.</p>

<p>As Grandpa Martin had said, Ted had
tried to crawl under a place where a beam,
or a big piece of wood, made such a narrow
place that even a cat would have had hard
work to get under. But Ted was not hurt,
nor was Trouble, and when they had reached
down and lifted out the eggs, and the hay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
and straw had been brushed from Ted and
his little brother, they only laughed.</p>

<p>The rest of the eggs were soon gathered,
and then came a fine supper with plenty of
rich milk for the Curlytops, to give them
rosy cheeks as well as curling hair.</p>

<p>The next day Jan and Ted went off in the
goat wagon again. They rode to the field
where they had seen the lame boy, and there
he was once more, waiting for them with
smiling face.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t come back that afternoon,”
Hal said. “The doctor had to do something
to this foot of mine.”</p>

<p>“Is it getting better?” asked Jan softly.</p>

<p>“Oh, heaps better! Why, I believe I could
kick a football over the moon!” and he
laughed. “You see,” he went on, “they’ve
put an extra heavy shoe on this lame foot
to make it straight. That’s why I can kick
so well with it. And it’s a fine shoe for not
wearing out. It’s got iron in the sole. Why,
that shoe will last longer than three of the
kind I have on my other foot. It isn’t everybody
who can have a shoe like that—one
that hardly ever wears out!” and he held up
the big boot-like shoe and brace he had to
wear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“I’m thinking of joining some football
team that wants a good kicker,” he laughingly
continued. “If you know of anyone
send them my address,” and he smiled at
Ted.</p>

<p>“I will,” promised the Curlytop lad.
“But tell us about the Home and the party
you’re going to have.”</p>

<p>“Our grandma is going to bake a cake,”
observed Jan.</p>

<p>“That’s nice!” exclaimed Hal. “I like
cakes,” and he told about the affair that
would take place in about a month—an affair
in which it was hoped all the people in
the country round about would take part—to
raise money for the Home, where cripples
were cured and made well and strong.</p>

<p>“Well, I must be getting back,” said Hal,
after a while. “There goes the supper flag,”
and he pointed to one fluttering on the pole
in front of the Home.</p>

<p>“We’ll drive you over in the goat wagon,”
offered Ted. “Nicknack hasn’t done much
pulling to-day.”</p>

<p>“Why do you call your goat Nicknack?”
asked Hal.</p>

<p>“Oh, he nicks and nacks at so many funny
things when he eats,” explained Jan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>They made room for Hal in the wagon,
which had plenty of soft cushions in it.
These were needed, for the cart had no
springs and the road was rough. On the
way to the Home, Ted and Jan told how
Trouble had cut up the feather bed.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad he thought of me,”
laughed Hal, “but I’m sorry he made so
much work.”</p>

<p>“He was awful funny to see!” giggled
Ted. “All feathers!”</p>

<p>When they were a little way from the
Home, Hal said:</p>

<p>“You’d better stop now, and let me walk
the rest of the way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” objected Ted.</p>

<p>“Yes, it will be better. I’m used to it, and
if some of the others saw me having a ride
they’d want one, too.”</p>

<p>“We’ll give them all a ride some day,”
agreed Jan, who saw that Hal’s idea was a
good one.</p>

<p>“Will you? That will be fine!” cried the
lame boy. “Let me know when you’re ready
to do it, and I’ll tell the Superintendent. It
will be great! Some of the boys and girls
can’t walk. A goat ride would be fine for
them!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>Ted and Jan promised to come the next
day in the morning, and give as many rides
as they could. But the next day it rained
and also the next, so they had to wait about
giving a treat to the cripples.</p>

<p>“Before you do it you had better see Hal,”
said Mother Martin, when, on the third day,
in the morning, the sun shining brightly,
the Curlytops said they thought they would
go to the Home with Nicknack. “Meet him
in the field where you saw him before, and
plan to give the rides to the lame children
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>So Ted and Jan, taking Baby William,
once more set off for the little hill, from the
top of which they had such a fine view of the
Home.</p>

<p>But Hal was not there in his usual place.
Nor could he be seen as the Curlytops looked
for him.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s on his way,” suggested Jan.
“We can leave Nicknack here, eating grass,
and walk down to meet him. Our goat will
be all right.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Ted.</p>

<p>Off they started, leading Trouble between
them. They went into the next field, across
which Hal always came and went on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
trips from and to the Home, and as they
came to the top of a little hill, and looked
down they saw what they had not seen before,
a big flock of sheep feeding. They
came upon the animals very suddenly, and
before Jan, Ted and Trouble could go back
some of the sheep walked toward them, and
formed in a ring around them.</p>

<p>“Oh! I wonder if they’ll hurt us?” asked
Jan, her voice trembling a little.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Ted quickly, but he was
not sure. Some of the sheep were coming
very near, and one or two of them pushed
their heads close against the children.</p>

<p>“I don’t like ’em!” cried Trouble, trying
to hide behind Jan. “Dey’s too many ob de
sheeps!”</p>

<p>There were a large number in the flock,
and those that had been feeding at the far
end of the pasture now came to join the others,
standing about the Curlytops, penning
them in.</p>

<small>THE CURLYTOPS GO FISHING</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, Ted! what shall we do?” asked Jan,
as she looked at the sheep all around them.
“They may knock us down and walk on us!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess they won’t do that. They
don’t seem like bad sheep.”</p>

<p>So far the animals had been rather gentle,
though they did crowd too closely around
the children. They poked at them with their
heads, and some, that had horns, seemed to
want to try their sharp points on Trouble’s
fat, chubby, bare legs.</p>

<p>“Go ’way—bad sheeps!” he called to
them. But the sheep only went “Baa-a-a-a!”</p>

<p>“Oh, here comes an old ram!” called Jan.</p>

<p>“Yes, and he’s a big one,” announced
Ted, and he looked about for a stick, a stone,
or something he could throw at the ram if it
should try to butt him, his sister or Trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“Make sheeps go away!” begged Baby
William, ready to cry.</p>

<p>“Shoo! Scat!” called Jan, shaking her
skirts at the animals.</p>

<p>“That’s the way to drive chickens or a cat,
but not sheep,” Ted told her.</p>

<p>“Then you drive ’em off!” begged Jan.
“I don’t like it here! I wish we hadn’t
come! Oh, they’ll knock us down if they’re
not careful!”</p>

<p>The sheep were crowding more closely
than ever about the children. Perhaps the
woolly animals meant no harm, and were
only wondering what the Curlytops were doing
in the pasture. But the sheep certainly
did crowd too much, and Jan and Ted had all
they could do to save themselves from being
pushed over. They tried to keep Trouble between
them, for Baby William was much
frightened.</p>

<p>“Whose sheep are they?” asked Jan, as
she tried to walk out from the flock toward
the fence. “They weren’t here the other
day.”</p>

<p>“I guess they belong to the man who owns
the farm next to Grandpa Martin’s,” said
Teddy. “They weren’t here before, or Hal
wouldn’t have crossed this field. Go on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
away! Get back there!” Ted suddenly cried,
as he saw the big ram pushing aside the
sheep in the outer ring, as though he wanted
to get in himself closer to the children.</p>

<p>Ted found a stone on the ground near his
feet, and, picking it up, threw at the ram.
The stone struck the animal on his big,
curved horns, and bounced off, not hurting
him any, and not scaring him, which was
what Ted wanted to do.</p>

<p>“Do sheep ever bite?” whispered Jan, as
she got closer to her brother.</p>

<p>“No!” he said, more to make his sister feel
less afraid, than because he was sure they
did not. “Anyhow, they don’t bite very
hard.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t like even little bites,” returned
Janet.</p>

<p>“I won’t let ’em bite you at all,” promised
Ted, though how he was going to stop the
sheep from doing this, especially the ram
with his big horns, the Curlytop boy did not
quite know. And, as he looked at those
horns, he was sure a blow from them would
be worse than a bite.</p>

<p>“They’re bigger than Nicknack’s,”
thought Ted.</p>

<p>“Where’s our goat?” asked Trouble, peering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
out from where he had tried to hide himself
behind Jan. “Where’s Nicknack?”</p>

<p>“Back in the field where we left him,” answered
Ted. “Do you want him, Trouble?”</p>

<p>“Maybe him could make sheeps go ’way,”
answered Baby William. “Nicknack could
hit ’em wif his horns.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he could and maybe he couldn’t,”
answered Ted. “Anyhow,” he said to himself,
“I wish we were back in the goat wagon.
If I’d’ve known these sheep was here I
wouldn’t have come in this field!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sheep were pressing closer
and closer about the Curlytops and Trouble.
The woolly animals perhaps meant no harm,
and might not have hurt the children. But
the old ram was anxious to get very close
to the two little boys and their sister. Maybe
he wanted to make sure they would not
bother the sheep, for the ram of a flock of
sheep is a sort of guard, or policeman, you
know.</p>

<p>And the ram, pushing his way in through
the flock from the outside, kept edging the
sheep nearer the three children.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed Janet. “I don’t
like this a bit!”</p>

<p>“It isn’t much fun,” agreed her brother.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
“Maybe we can get out. Come on, we’ll
try.”</p>

<p>He started to push his way through the
flock, but the big ram gave a loud “Baa-a-a-a!”
and lowered his head and horns as if
to tell Ted that this was no time for going
away.</p>

<p>Suddenly, when Janet felt that she must
cry, and tears were already in the eyes of
Baby William, a voice called to the children:</p>

<p>“Hi there! Don’t be afraid! I’ll make
the sheep go away!”</p>

<p>They looked up, expecting to see Grandpa
Martin, or perhaps their father. Instead,
they saw lame Hal Chester climbing the
fence to get into the field where the ram and
others of the flock had penned in the Curlytops.</p>

<p>“Go back! Go back!” yelled Ted. “The
sheep are bad!”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid!” called out Hal. “I’ve
got something to make them be good!”</p>

<p>“Oh, he has got something!” exclaimed
Jan. “It’s in his cap. I wonder what it is?”</p>

<p>Hal was carrying something in his cap,
which he held upside down in one hand. He
scrambled over the fence in his funny way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
and then came on toward the sheep and the
children, swinging his lame foot along after
him.</p>

<p>“I’m coming!” he called. “I’ll soon make
those sheep go away!”</p>

<p>“Do you—do you s’pose he’s got a gun?”
asked Jan. “Will he shoot the sheep?”</p>

<p>“No! Course not!” answered Ted. “He
couldn’t carry a gun in his cap that way.”</p>

<p>“Then what is it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Hal came a little nearer. He was at the
outer rim of the flock of sheep now, and the
Curlytops saw him take something from his
cap and throw it on the ground. Instantly
the sheep nearest him scattered and began
licking up what had come from the lame
boy’s cap.</p>

<p>He came forward a little farther and scattered
some more of the stuff which, Jan and
Ted could see, was white. More sheep
spread out and away from the Curlytops and
began licking up with their tongues what
Hal had spread on the ground for them.</p>

<p>“Here, old ram, this is for you!” and Hal
laid some of the white stuff in a little pile
right in front of the big-horned animal. The
ram gave a loud “Baa-a-a-a!” and began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
eagerly licking up what Hal had given him.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s sugar!” exclaimed Jan.</p>

<p>“No, it’s salt,” explained the lame boy
with a laugh. “Sheep love salt better than
sugar, though they may eat that, too, for all
I know. But they’ll do almost anything for
salt, and so will cows and horses, at times.
So when I scattered this salt about the sheep
just broke away from you to eat it. Now
you can get away and they’ll never notice
you.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get the salt?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“Oh, I found some over in that other
field,” and he pointed behind him. “You see
the farmers around here have wooden
troughs in some of the pastures where they
salt their cattle. When I came from the
Home, and saw the sheep in my field, I
thought they might make trouble, as I hadn’t
seen any around here before. I call this <i>my</i>
field,” he went on, motioning to the one
where the Curlytops had first seen him.
“Though, of course, I don’t own it. But it’s
just as nice as if I did. For I can hop along
in it, and see the daisies and buttercups and
dandelions in the green grass.</p>

<p>“They’re just like the jewels the Princess
Blue Eyes wears around her neck,” he went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
on. “The flowers are, I mean. And they’re
much nicer than real diamonds, for nobody
wants to take them. I can leave ’em out in
the fields all night, and they’re safe here in
the morning, or whenever the Princess Blue
Eyes wants to come and get them.”</p>

<p>“Who is the Princess Blue Eyes?” asked
Jan.</p>

<p>“Oh, she—she’s just a make-believe,” said
Hal softly, and his cheeks turned red. “I
make up stories about her you know,” he
went on. “I pretend that she likes me, and
I like her and—and some day maybe she is
going to change my crooked foot into a
straight one. Anyhow, if she doesn’t maybe
Dr. Wade will. But I’ll tell you more about
Princess Blue Eyes some day.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would,” half whispered Jan.
“I love fairy stories.”</p>

<p>“But what made you think of the salt?”
asked Ted.</p>

<p>“Oh, when I started across my field and
saw the sheep eating some of the crown
jewels of the Princess Blue Eyes,” answered
Hal with a laugh, “I thought of the salt I’d
seen in that other field, so I went back for
some. Then I saw you all penned in by the
sheep, and I was glad I had it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“So are we!” laughed Jan.</p>

<p>She could laugh now, for the sheep were
so busy licking up the salt Hal had scattered
that they paid no more attention to the
Curlytops. Trouble was lifted over to the
other side of the fence, where Nicknack was
still eating grass. Jan, Ted and Hal followed,
and then the three children and Baby
William sat down in the shade of a big elm
tree and talked.</p>

<p>It was two or three days after this, and
Hal had been given several rides in the goat
wagon, that, one afternoon when he was
about to go back to the Home to supper, he
said:</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever go fishing?”</p>

<p>“Fishing? Where?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“In Clover Lake. There are some boats
on it that belong to the Home. Sometimes
the nurses or the doctors take the boys and
girls out for a row. I can row myself, and
they let me once in a while. But they never
let me go fishing, and I’d just love to! I
was thinking maybe if you went fishing I
could go with you.”</p>

<p>“We <i>will</i> go!” cried Ted, who was used to
at least starting to do whatever he thought
would be fun. He did not always finish,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
though, for his father or mother often stopped
him.</p>

<p>“It will be great to go fishing!” went on
Ted. “Grandpa Martin has a boat on the
lake. I’ll ask him if we can’t go and take
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, will you?” cried Hal, with eager,
sparkling eyes. “It will be the best fun
ever. I wonder if they’ll let me go?” and he
looked wistfully over toward the big, red
brick building—the Home.</p>

<p>“I’ll get my father to ask them,” said
Jan. “I’ll tell them how you scared the
sheep away from us with salt, and everything
like that.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t scare the sheep,” said Hal. “I
wouldn’t want to do that. I like ’em. But
I knew salt would scatter them better than
by throwing stones. Oh, I do hope we can
go fishing.”</p>

<p>He and the Curlytops did. Grandpa Martin
spoke to the superintendent of the Home,
and as Hal was quite well and strong except
for his lame foot and as Daddy Martin
promised to go along in the boat to see that
all was well, the little party started off on
Clover Lake one morning.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>NICKNACK RUNS AWAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Clover Lake</span> was not far from the farmhouse
where the Curlytops were spending
their happy vacation days in the country.
Nor was it far from the Home where Hal
Chester and other crippled boys and girls
were staying until they were made well and
strong. The Curlytops and Daddy Martin
drove over to the Home in Grandpa Martin’s
big wagon and there found Hal, all ready
and eagerly waiting. He had been sitting
on the steps with his little packet of lunch
ever since sunrise, one of the nurses said.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve got some lunch, too!” cried
Janet. “We’ve got sandwiches, and a bottle
of milk and——”</p>

<p>“We’ve got enough so we can be shipwrecked
if we want to,” interrupted Teddy
eagerly.</p>

<p>“That will be heaps of fun,” agreed Hal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
“I never was really shipwrecked, though
I’ve often pretended to be with the Princess.
On a desert island, too.”</p>

<p>Some of the other lame boys and girls
wished they, too, might go off in a boat for
a day’s picnic, and Daddy Martin promised
to take them some other time.</p>

<p>Hal climbed up into the wagon, and off
they started, driving through a shady lane
down toward the lake. A big, safe rowboat
was waiting for them, and in this the children
took their places.</p>

<p>“Please may I help row?” asked Hal of
Daddy Martin.</p>

<p>“Do you think you can?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! My arms are strong. It’s only
one leg that I’m weak in, and I’m glad of
that, for I don’t row with my legs,” and he
laughed in a very jolly way.</p>

<p>“You’d never know he was crippled to
hear him,” whispered Ted to his sister.</p>

<p>“He’s such a nice boy,” said Janet. “I
like him.”</p>

<p>“Well, you may row a bit,” agreed Daddy
Martin, when he noticed that Hal knew just
how to get into a boat, not stepping on the
edges and almost tipping the boat over the
way some people do, but putting his foot exactly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
in the middle to balance it properly.</p>

<p>Then they started out on the lake. The
sun shone, the waters sparkled, there was
just a little wind—not a bit too much—and
all along the shore were green trees, leaning
over, some with their branches in the water
as though they were whispering to the little
waves that reached up to kiss the green
leaves.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll see who’ll get the first bite,”
said Daddy Martin, when the hooks were
baited and tossed over the side of the boat.
“We must all sit quietly so as not to scare
the fish.”</p>

<p>“Trouble would like it here,” said Jan, in
a low voice, when she had waited patiently
for some time for a bite. “He loves the
water and lots of times he fishes with a bent
pin in our brook at home.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he falls in, too,” added Teddy.
“But we mustn’t talk and scare the fish.
Must we, Daddy?”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps it would be better to keep
quiet, though I hardly imagine a fish can
hear a whisper. Still it’s just as well
Trouble stayed at home with his mother.
He’d be wiggling about and maybe he’d fall
out of the boat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>In silence they all watched their lines, each
one hoping for a bite. Suddenly Ted gave
his pole an upward jerk. So unexpectedly
did he do it that he fell over backward off
the seat, and he might have toppled into the
lake, only that his father quickly put out his
arm and caught the little boy.</p>

<p>“Why, The-o-dore!” exclaimed Mr. Martin,
in the way Ted’s mother sometimes
spoke to him. “What <i>are</i> you trying to
do?”</p>

<p>“I—I had a fish on my hook, and I pulled
up quick so he wouldn’t get off. But he did.
Oh, he was a big one!”</p>

<p>“But you nearly went overboard,” returned
his father, “and then you would have
been shipwrecked, whether you wanted to or
not. Besides, it wasn’t a fish you caught.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t?” cried Ted. “What was it?
It pulled like a fish.”</p>

<p>“It was that big bunch of weeds,” went
on Mr. Martin, laughing and pointing to
some green ones slowly floating away from
the boat. “Your hook caught in them,
Teddy, and the motion of the water, down
near the bottom of the lake, made it feel, I
suppose, as though a fish were nibbling.
But never pull your line up so suddenly as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
you did, even if you think you have a fish.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” promised Ted. “I don’t want
to fall into the water.”</p>

<p>When his hook caught in the weeds the
bait had been torn off, but when some fresh
had been put on the little boy once more
tossed his line into the water and again
waited.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Jan moved slowly in her seat
and whispered:</p>

<p>“Daddy! Daddy! I’m not sure, but I
<i>think</i> I’ve got a bite!”</p>

<p>Mr. Martin looked at the cork float on
Jan’s line. It was pulled down under the
water a little way, and then bobbed up again.
It did this several times, and then, finally, it
went all the way under and Jan’s pole bent.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have got a fish!” she cried, not
whispering this time.</p>

<p>“Yes, you have!” exclaimed Daddy Martin.
“Pull in, Jan! Pull in, but not too
suddenly!”</p>

<p>Jan raised the tip of her pole in the air.
This brought the line closer to the side of
the boat, and, reaching over, Mr. Martin
caught the string and pulled on it. Out of
the water he lifted a good-sized fish, wiggling
and trying to get off Janet’s hook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“That’s the first,” said Daddy Martin, as
he put the fish in a little water-box under one
of the seats. “Now let’s see who’ll get the
next.”</p>

<p>To Hal’s delight he was the lucky one, and
then they each caught a fish, Janet landing
a very large one, which her father had to
help pull in. In about an hour there were
enough fish caught for two large meals.</p>

<p>“We’ll go ashore and have lunch now,”
said Daddy Martin. “There is no use in
catching more fish than we really need.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to cook some of them?”
asked Hal. “I’d like to do that. It would
be just like camping out, and, oh! I would
like to camp out. Sometimes at night when
I can’t sleep, I pretend I’m camping on an
island with Princess Blue Eyes.”</p>

<p>“Well, that would be nice,” said Daddy
Martin. “But I didn’t bring along anything
with which to cook the fish, and,
though I might manage to start a fire and
broil some fish over it with a sharp stick for
a fork, we don’t need to. We have a nice
lunch all ready put up for us.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can go camping some day,”
suggested Ted.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” his father agreed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“I know a fine place!” exclaimed Hal.
“It’s on Star Island.”</p>

<p>“Where’s that?” Ted asked.</p>

<p>“Over there in the middle of the lake.
You can just see it—that patch of green in
the blue water,” and Hal pointed.</p>

<p>“Let’s go there now!” proposed Janet.</p>

<p>“It’s too far,” her father said. “Some
other time we may go.”</p>

<p>“Let’s eat,” suggested Ted. “I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>“Well, then we’ll get out the lunch,” decided
his father, and they were soon having
a little picnic on the shore.</p>

<p>“It would be great to go camping on that
island,” said Ted to Hal a little later, as they
sat down near the edge of Clover Lake to
finish the last of their sandwiches. “Were
you ever there?”</p>

<p>“Never camping. But I’ve been on Star
Island. It’s a queer place. Some folks say
it isn’t a good place.”</p>

<p>“Not good? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well,” and Hal dropped his voice to a
whisper. “Some folks say there’s ghosts on
the island.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! Ghosts! There aren’t any! My
mother and daddy wouldn’t let us believe in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
such silly things as ghosts!” and Ted
laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t <i>believe</i> in ’em myself—though
I do pretend lots of fairy stories
with Princess Blue Eyes,” said Hal quickly.
“But I’ve heard fishermen who come to the
Home tell about seeing queer blue lights on
Star Island at night.”</p>

<p>“Fireflies, maybe.”</p>

<p>“Fireflies don’t make a blue light,” Hal
said. “But don’t tell anybody, and maybe
some day you and I’ll go there and find out
what it is.”</p>

<p>“Maybe! That would be great!” cried
Ted.</p>

<p>After the lunch, the little picnic party
walked about in the woods, had a drink at a
cool spring and then started to row back
toward home with the fish they had caught.
Hal was allowed to pull the oars part of the
way. Ted tried it, but he was not as strong
in his arms as was the lame boy, who was
older than Ted and who showed that he
did know something about handling a boat.</p>

<p>Some of the fish were given to Hal to have
cooked at the Home, the superintendent
promising that this would be done, and the
rest were taken to Cherry Farm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“Let’s go over and see how fast the cherries
are getting ripe,” said Ted to Janet one
day, about a week after the fishing party.
“We can tell grandpa then, and he can get
ready to sell ’em so he won’t lose his farm.”</p>

<p>“Is grandpa really going to lose the
farm?” asked Janet of her mother.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re not sure yet,” was the answer.
“He is working hard to get money to
pay what he owes, and we are all helping
him. But don’t you little tots worry about
that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we want to help, too!” declared Ted.
“We’re going to help bring in the cherries
when they’re ripe enough to sell. That’s
where we’re going now—to look at them.”</p>

<p>“Well, be careful,” cautioned his mother.
“Are you going in the goat wagon?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s such fun driving Nicknack,”
replied Jan. “I can make him go as good as
Ted, and even Trouble holds the reins sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is a good goat,” said Mother
Martin. “Well, drive along with you, if
you’re going, but don’t eat any green cherries.”</p>

<p>The Curlytops promised they would not,
and they were soon on their way down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
road toward the part of the farm where the
most of the cherry trees were ripening their
red and black fruit.</p>

<p>“There’s Hal!” cried Jan, as she saw the
lame boy sitting under a tree beside the road.
“Let’s take him with us—there’s lots of
room.”</p>

<p>“An’ I dot two-ten tookies!” added
Trouble, as if eating was all they ever went
out to do.</p>

<p>“That’s enough for a fine meal!” laughed
Hal, who heard what Baby William said.</p>

<p>“Want to come?” cried Ted.</p>

<p>“I should say I did! I came out here to
meet Princess Blue Eyes, but I guess she
must have a party at her castle, or else she
has to hide away from the Mosquito Dwarf,
so she won’t be here to-day.”</p>

<p>“Who is the Mosquito Dwarf?” asked
Jan, as Hal took his place in the goat wagon,
and Nicknack, with a little “Baa-a-a!”
started off again.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s a bad chap who’s always buzzing
around Princess Blue Eyes,” answered the
lame boy. “He bothers her terribly, and
sometimes she has to call in the Chinese
Giant to drive away the Mosquito Dwarf.
Then he has to go and hide in the swamp.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“Dat’s a nice story—me like—go on!” ordered
Trouble, who had nestled in Hal’s
arms, and seemed to think the lame boy was
telling a fairy tale as Mother Martin often
did.</p>

<p>“That’s all to the story this time,”
laughed Hal. “There’ll be more later.
Where are you Curlytops going?” for he,
too, as had nearly everyone around Cherry
Farm, had learned to call Jan and Ted that.</p>

<p>“Just going over to see if the cherries are
ripe,” explained Ted.</p>

<p>“An’ we dassen’t eat no dreen ones,” said
Trouble, “’cause if we does we dets de tummy-tummy
ache.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be careful,” promised Hal with a
laugh.</p>

<p>Up little hills and down little green dales
went Nicknack, drawing the wagon load of
little children, until, after a while, he came
to a stop in the farthest end of the cherry
grove, more than a mile from grandpa’s
farmhouse.</p>

<p>“Yes, the cherries are getting ripe,” said
Hal, as he and Ted walked under the trees.
“In another week or so they ought to be
ready to pick. My! what a lot there’s going
to be!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“Yes, grandpa will have piles of cherries,”
said Teddy. “And I guess he’ll need
’em, too—or the money he can get when he
sells ’em.”</p>

<p>“I thought your grandpa didn’t need
money because he was rich,” said Hal.</p>

<p>“He used to be,” explained Jan. “But he
lost a lot of money when the floods came this
spring, and now maybe he’ll lose the farm.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope not!” cried Hal. “I wish I
could help,” he said softly, as he looked back
over the rolling fields of green. “But a lame
boy can’t do much.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to help gather the cherries
and bring them in with Nicknack’s cart,”
explained Janet.</p>

<p>“Oh, couldn’t I do some of that?” begged
Hal, his eyes shining.</p>

<p>“Course you can!” declared Ted.</p>

<p>They got out of the little wagon, leaving
the goat to nibble grass under the trees, and
walked along through the grove. Trouble,
who was toddling along, his hand in one of
Jan’s, was eating a molasses cookie, getting
almost as much on the outside of his mouth
as he did on the inside. But he was happy.</p>

<p>“Oh, ’ook at de funny bug on my tookie!”
suddenly called the little fellow, speaking in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
a mumbled voice, for his mouth was half
full. “I dess he wants a bite, too.”</p>

<p>“That’s not a bug! It’s a big bumble bee
and he might sting you,” said Hal.</p>

<p>“There’s a lot of bees around here!”
called Ted. “I guess they come to get honey
from the flowers.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope they don’t sting us,” and
Jan brushed her handkerchief around her
head, for a bee was buzzing near her.</p>

<p>“Oh, look at your goat!” suddenly cried
Hal. “I guess a bee must have stung him!”</p>

<p>Nicknack was acting in a queer manner.
He was running around in a circle, dragging
the wagon after him, almost turning it
over at times, and, all the while he was crying:</p>

<p>“Baa! Baa-a-a! Baa-a-a-a-a-a-a!”</p>

<p>“Whoa there! Whoa!” called Ted.</p>

<p>But the goat did not mind. With a kick
of his heels, and a last “Baa-a-a-a!” Nicknack
ran away, down through the cherry
grove and out toward the road.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>TED AND THE HAY RAKE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Stop</span>, Nicknack! Whoa, there! Whoa!”
cried Ted, running after the goat that was
now leaping along, his little, short, stubby
tail bobbing up and down the way the corks
did on the fishing lines.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ted! Do stop him!” begged Jan.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m trying to do,” answered
her brother. He ran as fast as he could, and
his sister started to follow, but she felt the
drag of Trouble, whose hand she still held,
and she knew she could never catch the goat.</p>

<p>Ted could not do it either, and he knew
this before he had run far, for Nicknack was
going very fast.</p>

<p>“He is really running away!” cried Hal.
“It’s too bad. If it wasn’t for my foot——”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry about catching him,”
said Ted, coming to a stop and laughing. “I
guess it won’t hurt him to run, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
wagon is pretty strong. He’s going in a
straight line now, and won’t tip it over.”</p>

<p>“But he’s our goat—and he’s gone!”
wailed Janet. “Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“He won’t go farther than to Cherry
Farm,” was Ted’s next remark. “He knows
there aren’t any bees there. Some one will
take care of him. But we’ll have to walk
back. That’s the worst of it.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t so bad,” came from Hal
cheerfully. Ted had been worried about the
lame boy for fear he could not take the mile-long
walk back to the Home. “I can manage
all right.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you can?” asked Jan.</p>

<p>“Oh, sure. It will be fun. We’ll go slow
on account of your baby brother.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll have to. Trouble isn’t very
fond of walking, though he is pretty good
sometimes. My, but Nicknack did run!”</p>

<p>“Guess you would, too, if you were a goat
and a bee bit you,” put in Ted.</p>

<p>“Mother will wonder what’s become of us
when she sees him,” murmured Jan, trying
to look for their horned pet. But he was out
of sight down the tree-shaded road by this
time.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Ted. “We’d better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
go right on back to Cherry Farm to let
her see we’re all right.”</p>

<p>“Me want more tookies first!” exclaimed
Trouble.</p>

<p>“Yes, we might as well eat a little,” agreed
Ted.</p>

<p>Nora, as she often did, had put up a little
lunch for the children. So they sat under
the cherry trees and ate, getting water from
a little spring not far away. Ted thought
they might find some ripe cherries on the
trees, but they were all still so green that
they did not taste good.</p>

<p>“And now let’s start for home,” proposed
Janet. “Come on.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Ted.</p>

<p>But they had walked only a little way
when Trouble lived up to his name and suddenly
sat down on the grass.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jan. “Get
up and walk along. I’d carry you, only I’m
not big enough. Come on!” and she pulled
him by the hand.</p>

<p>“I’se tired,” Trouble declared. “Don’t
want to walk—want ride. Go bring Nicknack
an’ give Trouble ride in wagon.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t get Nicknack. He’s gone
home!” Jan explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“Well, den you go git him an’ me wait
here,” and Baby William squirmed around
in the grass until he had made a sort of little
nest where he sat.</p>

<p>“No, no! You must come on!” ordered
his sister.</p>

<p>“Trouble tan’t tum. Trouble goin’
s’eep!” and he closed his eyes and made believe
he was taking a nap.</p>

<p>“Oh, what shall I do?” asked Jan of the
two boys. “Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“Let me see what I can do,” said Ted, and
going up to his baby brother he whispered in
his ear:</p>

<p>“Trouble, if you walk home I’ll ask daddy
to buy you a lollypop when we go to the village.”</p>

<p>“When will we goes to village?”</p>

<p>“This afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Want to go now!” declared Baby William
closing his eyes again, to show that he
was going to sleep and stay where he was unless
he could have his own way.</p>

<p>“But we have to walk to get to the village,”
said Teddy. “And you must walk
with us.”</p>

<p>“Don’t want walk—want ride!”</p>

<p>“Oh, see the pretty flowers down there!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
called Jan, pointing to some yellow buttercups
a little farther along. “If I can get
him started to picking flowers he’ll walk
on without knowing it,” she whispered to
her brother and Hal. “Come and get the
flowers,” she begged.</p>

<p>“Don’t want f’owers,” murmured
Trouble, and his voice sounded as though he
were really going to sleep now.</p>

<p>“Oh, if he does go to sleep,” said Janet,
“we’ll never get him home until he wakes
up; and then what will mother say?”</p>

<p>“Maybe I can make something so we can
get him home,” said Hal.</p>

<p>“Do you mean without making him
walk?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“Yes. Wait and I’ll see what I can do,”
and the lame boy started for a patch of
woods near the cherry grove.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” called Ted.
“Can’t I help?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes—maybe. I’m going to cut
down two long branches first.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve got a knife and I’ll help cut,”
offered Ted, and he hurried on after Hal,
leaving Jan, rather worried and anxious, beside
Baby William, who was still curled up
in the little grass nest he had made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>“Here, you cut this branch, and I’ll take
the one over there,” and Hal pointed to the
two he meant.</p>

<p>“How are you going to make a wagon out
of ’em, and where will you get the wheels?”
Ted questioned.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say I was going to make a
wagon,” replied the lame boy with a laugh.
“At least it isn’t a wagon with wheels. It’s
the kind the Indians used to make—two long
poles with a seat between——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know what you mean!” exclaimed
Ted. “I saw ’em once when the Wild West
show came to our town. The Indians fastened
two poles, one on each side of a pony
and he dragged them along, the other ends
dragging on the ground.”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” said Hal. “I thought we
could drag Trouble home that way.”</p>

<p>“We can! It’ll be great!” exclaimed Ted,
as he began to cut at the branch Hal had
pointed out while the lame boy hacked off
another for himself.</p>

<p>When Hal had done this he went over and
helped Teddy with his branch. Then the two
boys fastened the poles together with pieces
of wild grapevine, and made a sort of seat
with a blanket and a cushion that had fallen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
out of the goat wagon when Nicknack nearly
upset it.</p>

<p>“Now you can ride home, Trouble!” cried
Jan, when she saw what her brother and his
friend had made. “See the lovely wagon!”</p>

<p>“Dat’s nice!” said Trouble, after looking
at it from all sides. “Me ’ike it. Me ride!”
and he climbed onto the seat.</p>

<p>“Now giddap, hosses!” he cried.</p>

<p>Hal and Ted turned themselves into
“horses,” and each one took an end of a pole
over his shoulder. The other ends dragged
on the ground, just as the Indians let their
funny carts drag. Jan walked beside her
little brother, to see that he did not fall
off.</p>

<p>“It’s almost as good as the goat wagon,”
she said. “But isn’t it hard to pull, Ted?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. Not very. Anyhow it’s mostly
down hill home, and we’ll soon be there.”</p>

<p>“Can you stand it, Hal?” Jan asked the
lame boy.</p>

<p>“Course. I’m strong!”</p>

<p>In a way he was stronger than Ted, for he
was several years older. Between them they
managed to drag Baby William down to the
road and along that toward the farmhouse.
Before they reached it they saw Grandpa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
Martin driving rapidly to meet them in the
big wagon. Mother Martin was with him.</p>

<p>“Oh, children!” she cried. “What happened?
We were so frightened when we saw
the goat wagon come back without you!
What happened?”</p>

<p>“Bee stung Nicknack and he runned
away,” explained Ted. “But we’re all right
now. Had to make this new kind of baby
carriage for Trouble. He wouldn’t walk.
Hal thought of making it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a time you must have had! It
was very good of you, Hal, to think of it,”
said Mrs. Martin. “Trouble, you can’t go
with your brother and sister again if you are
such a bother.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he was all right. We didn’t mind
riding him home,” laughed Hal. “It was
fun.”</p>

<p>“Is our goat all right?” Ted asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. But he came in pretty well tired
out from his run,” explained Grandpa Martin.
“When I saw him I was afraid he had
upset the wagon and hurt you, so we started
out to pick you up.”</p>

<p>But everybody was happy now, and no one
was hurt, and soon, riding in grandpa’s
wagon, they were all safe at the farmhouse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
telling the rest of the family all that had
happened.</p>

<p>At first the Curlytops were afraid their
goat might be made ill from having been
stung by a bee.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better get a doctor for him,”
said Jan.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” laughed her father. “Nicknack
will be all right.”</p>

<p>And so he was, being as kind and gentle
as ever when the children went out to see
him. They wanted to hitch him up again
and drive Hal over to the Home, but Grandpa
Martin said he would take the lame boy
back in the big wagon. This was done, the
children going along for the sake of the
drive.</p>

<p>Haying time came a few days later, and
Grandpa Martin and his men were busy
drawing in the sweet-smelling loads, and
storing in the big barn the dried grass that
the horses would eat when winter came to
cover the green fields with white snow.</p>

<p>“Can’t we go out to the field and ride in
on a load of hay?” asked Jan.</p>

<p>“Yes! Come along!” cried her grandfather,
so she and Ted got in the big rick
wagon that went to the field empty to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
hauled back with such a big, towering load
on it.</p>

<p>The Curlytops played about in the field
while the hired men were piling the wagon
high with hay. The horse-rake, with which
the dried grass was pulled into long rows, to
be made into cocks, or little hills, later, made
a nice place for Ted and Jan to play.
They took turns sitting on the high iron
seat and making believe they were driving
a horse.</p>

<p>“Guess you’ll have to get down off that
hay-rake now, Curlytop,” called Grandpa
Martin to Ted after a while.</p>

<p>“Why?” the little boy asked.</p>

<p>“Because, The-o-dore,” and Grandpa
Martin’s eyes twinkled as he used the long
name which Ted’s mother called him only
on very special occasions, “we’re going to
hitch the horse to it and rake up the loose
hay about the field. You see a lot gets scattered
when we’re loading the wagon,” he explained,
“and we must rake it up to save it.
It isn’t right to waste hay, or anything else
that is food for real folks or animals. So
hop down.”</p>

<p>Ted jumped down to go over where his
sister was sitting in the shade of the big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
rick wagon, she having become tired of being
out in the sun with Ted.</p>

<p>One of the men hitched a horse to the rake
and drove about the field, collecting the loose
hay. The rake had two big wheels to it, with
a high seat in the middle. Behind the seat
were some curved prongs of iron, like the
teeth of your garden rake, only more than
fifty times larger. They were made large
to pile up a lot of hay at once.</p>

<p>When there was a big bunch of hay, held
in a lump by the curved teeth of the rake,
the man driving pulled a handle, the teeth
rose up in the air over the pile of hay and
left it to be gathered up and pitched on the
wagon. Then the man dropped the teeth and
they gathered up more wisps of the dried
grass.</p>

<p>“I wish I could do that,” said Ted, as,
sitting beside Jan, he watched the hay-rake
moving about the field.</p>

<p>“The-o-dore Martin! Don’t you dare!”
cried Jan.</p>

<p>“Dare what?”</p>

<p>“Get on that hay-rake.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe I won’t. But, just the
same, I wish you wouldn’t call me The-o-dore.
It sounds as if I’d done something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>“All right, I won’t,” laughed Jan. “I’ll
call you Curlytop.”</p>

<p>“All right,” and Teddy was satisfied.</p>

<p>But he kept on looking at the funny way
the big curved teeth of the hay-rake tilted
themselves up every time the man driving it
pulled the handle, and more than once Ted
said to himself:</p>

<p>“I wish I could do that.”</p>

<p>And finally, when the man got down off
the seat to go to the brook to get a drink of
water, and while Jan was trying to make a
doll by wadding up a wisp of hay and dressing
it in a green leaf, Teddy walked quietly
off by himself and did what he ought not to
have done. He climbed up on the seat of the
hay-rake, and took the reins of the horse in
his hands.</p>

<p>“I just want to see how it feels,” thought
Teddy.</p>

<p>And then, to his surprise, something happened.
The horse began walking quickly
down the field, pulling the rake after him,
and with it a big pile of hay caught in the
curved teeth.</p>

<p>“Oh! Whoa! Whoa there! Whoa!”
cried the frightened Teddy.</p>

<p>But the horse kept on going with the rake.</p>

<small>THE LOST DOLL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandpa Martin</span>, pausing in his work of
tossing hay up on the wagon to fan himself
with his big straw hat, looked across the
field. What he saw made him cry out:</p>

<p>“Look at that boy!”</p>

<p>He pointed toward Teddy on the hay-rake,
and one of the farm hands exclaimed:</p>

<p>“He’ll be hurt, sure! Does he know how
to drive a horse?”</p>

<p>“He can drive a goat a little,” said Jan.
“Oh, get him, Grandpa, ’fore he’s hurt!”
she cried.</p>

<p>“He oughtn’t to have got up there!” said
Grandpa Martin as he dropped his pitchfork
and ran after the hay-rake. One of the hired
men ran with him.</p>

<p>“Ted! Teddy! Stop the horse!” cried
grandpa, running faster.</p>

<p>“I’m trying to,” answered Ted, but his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
voice sounded faint and far off. “Whoa!”
he called, but instead of pulling back on the
reins as he ought to have done, he flapped
them up and down on the back of the horse.
And, as this was what other drivers did when
they wanted him to go faster, the horse did
not know what to do.</p>

<p>With his voice Teddy was telling the horse
to stop, but with the reins he was urging him
on. So the horse kept going.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to stop! I’ve got to stop!” said
the frightened boy to himself. “Maybe if I
pull on the handle, like the man did, and
raise up the rake, the horse will stop long
enough for me to jump down. I’ll try it.”</p>

<p>Then, before Grandpa Martin or the hired
man could reach Ted, he leaned forward.
But he did not pull the handle. His hand
just missed it and the next moment the little
boy fell from the high iron seat, right behind
the horse’s legs.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” screamed Jan.</p>

<p>“Good land!” cried Grandpa Martin.
“The boy will be hurt!”</p>

<p>But Teddy was a lucky little boy. Instead
of falling on the iron-shod feet of the horse,
he just missed them and rolled into a little
pile of hay. But the horse kept on going,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
and the next Ted knew, he was being rolled
along, over and over in a bundle of the dried
grass.</p>

<p>For the curved teeth of the big rake were
pulling him along, together with a bundle
of the hay, and he was so wrapped up in it,
like a Christmas doll in a package of straw
or excelsior, that Teddy was not even
scratched, though the ends of the hay did
tickle him and make him sneeze.</p>

<p>“Whoa, there! Whoa!” cried the hired
man in a loud voice. At the same time he ran
forward and caught hold of the reins. This
stopped the horse, and when the man and
Grandpa Martin raised the teeth of the rake,
and pulled apart the bundle of hay, there
was Ted inside it. He looked frightened.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ted! Teddy!” gasped Jan, running
up to him.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” asked one of the men.</p>

<p>“I guess not,” Ted slowly answered, as he
stood up. “I didn’t mean to do it,” he
added, looking at his grandfather.</p>

<p>“I should hope you didn’t! But don’t
dare get up on that rake again!”</p>

<p>“Not even when there isn’t a horse hitched
to it?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“No, even when there is no horse. That’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
for not being careful. You mustn’t do such
things, Theodore.”</p>

<p>Teddy looked a little ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>“I—I won’t do it any more,” he faltered.
“But it was awful funny being rolled along
over and over inside the rake.”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder you weren’t hurt,” said
Grandpa Martin. “It’s a good thing the
teeth of the rake are so big and curved, and
not sharp. Now go back and sit down until
we load the wagon.”</p>

<p>Grandpa and his men finished gathering
up the hay, and when the big wagon was
loaded he called:</p>

<p>“Come now, Curlytops! Up with you!”</p>

<p>Jan and Ted were tossed up on the very
top of the load. And such fun as it was to
ride along the road on the way back to the
barn! No matter how rough the journey
was the children never felt it, for the load
of hay was like a feather bed, and much nicer
than the Curlytops had thought. In the barn
they had fun, too, sliding down one side of
the big mow where the hay was stored.</p>

<p>Back they rode to the hay field again, and
this time Ted kept far away from the big
rake. He and Jan had a good time trying
to catch the grasshoppers which flew and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
hopped from one pile of the dried grass to
another.</p>

<p>Then came a final ride back to the barn on
the last load, and Ted and Jan were so tired
out and so drowsy from the sweet smell and
the heat that they fell asleep and had to be
lifted down.</p>

<p>“Oh, we had such dandy fun!” cried Jan
that night.</p>

<p>“And I had an adventure!” added Ted.
Then he told about being rolled along in the
big rake.</p>

<p>“Teddy! Teddy!” exclaimed his grandmother
when she heard the story, “what will
you do next?”</p>

<p>“Something one would never imagine a
child would think of—that is all you can be
certain of, Grandma,” put in the Curlytops’
mother, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Well, I wonder what we’ll do to-day?”
asked Ted of his sister the next morning
after breakfast, when they went out on the
porch to find the sun shining brightly after
a shower in the night.</p>

<p>“Can’t we go for a ride with Nicknack?
That would be fun.”</p>

<p>“No. One of the wheels of the goat wagon
needs fixing and grandpa is going to take it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
to the blacksmith shop. If we go anywhere
we’ll have to walk, Jan.”</p>

<p>“Then we can’t take Trouble,” declared
Jan, “for he doesn’t like to walk.”</p>

<p>“And Hal isn’t here to make a pole Indian
wagon like the one we made before.
What’ll we do?” added Ted.</p>

<p>Before Jan could answer she heard her
name called, and, looking toward the front
gate, she saw Mary Seaton, a little girl
with whom she sometimes played.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jan!” called Mary, “can you come
over to my house and bring your doll?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so. I’ll ask my mother.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin was willing, and soon, with
flaxen-haired Flo, her prettiest doll, in her
arms, Jan was ready to go with her little
playmate.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jan!” called her mother, as the two
girls were skipping out of the yard. “As
long as you are only going over to Mary’s,
can’t you take Trouble with you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, let’s!” cried Mary.</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll take him,” said Jan, and
she sighed a little. “But tell him, please,
Mother, that he mustn’t pull my doll’s hair.”</p>

<p>“No, he mustn’t do anything like that,”
said Mother Martin. “If you do, William, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
shall punish you when Jan brings you
home.”</p>

<p>“Me be dood!” promised Trouble.</p>

<p>“Well, if Jan’s going over to Mary’s, I
guess I’ll go and find Jimmie Dell or Hal
Chester and have some fun,” remarked Ted,
as, with hands in his pockets, he walked
slowly down the road.</p>

<p>The two little girls, with Baby William,
found a nice place to play on the shady porch
of the Seaton farmhouse, which was not far
from that of Grandpa Martin’s.</p>

<p>“We’ll have a little tea-party,” said Mary.</p>

<p>Her mother gave her some cookies and
some bread and butter, and with her toy set
of dishes Mary soon had a table set on a box
on the porch, and the two dolls were propped
up in front of it, while Jan and Mary fed
them—make-believe, of course.</p>

<p>“Me’s hungry, too,” said Trouble, as he
saw the things to eat.</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t have any now, because
you’re not a doll,” said Jan. “After the
dolls eat then you can, Trouble dear.”</p>

<p>Baby William seemed to be thinking about
this. It did not seem just fair that a real
flesh-and-blood chap should have to wait
until some dolls, who didn’t have any teeth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
got through with their make-believe eating.
Then, while Jan and Mary were busy pretending
their dolls were eating and talking
like grown-up people, Trouble toddled out
into the kitchen.</p>

<p>His sister and her playmate did not pay
much attention to him, and a little later the
two girls thought they would play another
game—that of “dress up like ladies.” To
do this Mary had to get some old, long
skirts from the attic, and Jan went with her
to help pick them out.</p>

<p>“Now you’ll be Mrs. Martin and I’ll be
Mrs. Seaton,” Mary explained, when they
were down on the porch again, ready for the
new game. “And we’ll take our dolls—they’ll
be our children you know——”</p>

<p>“But where is my doll?” cried Jan suddenly,
as she looked around. “She’s gone!
Oh, my lovely Flo doll is lost!”</p>

<p>There was only one doll at the play-party
table on the porch, and that was Mary’s.
Jan’s doll was gone, and so were some of
the cookies that had been on the toy plate in
front of her.</p>

<small>TED AND HIS KITE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two little girls stood and looked and
looked and looked. Then they looked once
more to make sure that the missing doll was
not somewhere on the porch—in a corner
perhaps. But Flo was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>“Where can she be?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“That’s what I want to know,” wailed
Jan. “Oh, if anybody has taken her
away——”</p>

<p>“Maybe they has,” suggested Mary.
“That is, unless maybe she walked away.
Was your doll a walking doll, Jan?”</p>

<p>“Nope! Dolls can’t walk!”</p>

<p>“I know mine can’t,” went on the other
little girl; “but my mamma read to me about
a little girl who had a doll that could walk.
She walked and talked when you wound up
a spring in the back of her dress.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my doll wasn’t that kind,” said Jan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
and as she talked she looked all around the
porch, even lifting up the cloth that was on
the box which was used for the play-party
table.</p>

<p>“I thought maybe she had eaten so much
she might have gone to sleep, and then she
would fall under the table,” said Jan to
Mary.</p>

<p>But Flo was not there.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you call her, the same way
our mammas call us when we go away?”
asked Mary.</p>

<p>“I could do that,” agreed Jan, and then
she called:</p>

<p>“Oh, Flo! I want you, dollie! Where are
you?”</p>

<p>But no answer came, and then Jan, with a
little laugh, said:</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s silly to call! A doll can’t hear,
of course. We only make-believe they can.
And this is real—it isn’t make-believe. Flo
is really gone!” and tears came into her
eyes.</p>

<p>“I’ll help you look for her,” offered Mary.
“We won’t play party any more. It won’t
be any fun. Come on, we’ll have a doll
hunt.”</p>

<p>“You’d better put your doll in the house,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
advised Jan. “Somebody may take her,
too.”</p>

<p>“I guess I will,” agreed Mary.</p>

<p>Then, when she came out after putting
her Anna Belle, as her doll was named,
safely in her little bed, the two girls began
once more to search for Flo.</p>

<p>They had looked in all the places they
could think of around the house and porch,
and were beginning on the bushes, which
were down along both sides of the path, when
Jan happened to think of her little brother.</p>

<p>“Oh, where is Trouble?” she suddenly
cried.</p>

<p>“Here I is,” came the quick answer, and
the little fellow, his face and hands very
dirty, came out from behind a snowball bush.
He had been picking the white balls that
looked like little drops of snow.</p>

<p>“Oh, Trouble! where have you been?”
asked Jan.</p>

<p>“And did you see anything of Jan’s doll?”
asked Mary.</p>

<p>“Yes, I sawed her,” answered Trouble,
and his sister noticed that Baby William
looked a little frightened, as if something
queer had happened.</p>

<p>“Where is she? Where is my Flo?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
asked Trouble’s sister quickly. “Tell me!”
she begged.</p>

<p>“Dog took her,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“A dog took my doll?” asked Jan.
“Whose dog? When?”</p>

<p>“’Ittle while ago. It was Mary’s dog,”
and Trouble threw a snowball at a fluttering
butterfly without hitting it.</p>

<p>“Mary’s dog took my doll?” cried Jan.
“Tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean our Rover?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“Yes—big-dog-Rover. He take Jan’s
doll.”</p>

<p>“But why did he do it?” Jan demanded.
“A doll isn’t good for a doggie to eat, and
Rover wouldn’t want to play with Flo. Why
did he take her?”</p>

<p>“I dess he wanted the ham bone,” was
Trouble’s answer.</p>

<p>“A ham bone? In my doll!” cried Jan.
“Flo hasn’t any ham bone!”</p>

<p>“She did have one,” explained Trouble,
and he never even smiled. “I gived her my
ham bone.”</p>

<p>“Your ham bone?” repeated Mary.
“Where did you get a ham bone, Trouble
Martin?”</p>

<p>“Offen your mamma’s table when she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
wasn’t in de titchen. I tooked de ham bone
to suck ’cause I was hungry.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he does do that, sometimes,” explained
Jan, as Mary looked at her in surprise.
“Mother often gives him one that’s
been boiled and’s had most of the meat cut
off. He likes to gnaw the bone and pretend
he’s a little dog.”</p>

<p>“And there was a ham bone out in our
kitchen,” said Mary. “I saw it there when
I went in to get some cookies. I’ll see if it’s
gone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if Trouble says he took it he did,”
replied Jan, and when Mary went to look,
surely enough the ham bone was gone. Mrs.
Seaton was not in the kitchen, having gone
to the cellar to get some molasses to make a
cake.</p>

<p>“But what did you do with the bone,
Trouble?” asked Jan. “And how did the
dog take my doll?”</p>

<p>“I did eat the ham bone,” said Baby William,
speaking very slowly and trying to use
the best words he knew, for he saw his sister
was very anxious. “I did eat the ham bone
and then big-dog-Rover he did come and
want some. So I did hide the ham bone
under your dollie’s dress so Rover not have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
it. I did not eat all de meat—I mean the
meat,” and Trouble corrected himself.</p>

<p>“You hid your ham bone under Flo’s
dress?” asked Jan.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>

<p>“And then what happened?”</p>

<p>“Then big-dog-Rover he take the dollie in
his mouth and he runned off with her, he did!
Now may I have a cookie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see what happened,” said Jan.
“Trouble wanted to keep the ham bone away
from Rover, so he hid it under Flo’s clothes.
Then your dog smelled it there and carried
away the doll and the bone, too.”</p>

<p>“I guess he did,” agreed Mary. “He
thought your doll was all one big ham bone
I guess. But where did Rover take it,
Trouble?” she asked Baby William.</p>

<p>“Don’t know. Big-dog-Rover runned
off.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried Jan. “If he’s buried
my doll, as dogs bury the bones they find,
she’ll be spoiled!”</p>

<p>“Maybe he hasn’t had time to bury it yet,”
said Mary. “Come on. I know where Rover
buries most of his bones. It’s in a soft place
near his kennel. Let’s run!”</p>

<p>And run Jan and Mary did, leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
Trouble on the stoop. The little boy at once
began to eat some of the cookies left on the
play-party table.</p>

<p>“There he is!” cried Mary, as she saw the
dog lying down in the grass near his kennel,
or house.</p>

<p>“And he’s eating something!” added Jan,
for Rover was certainly gnawing something
he held between his paws. “Oh, I hope it
isn’t my doll!”</p>

<p>“Rover wouldn’t eat a sawdust doll when
he could get a bone,” returned Mary.</p>

<p>And so it proved. As the little girls ran
up Rover wagged his tail as if saying he was
glad to see them, and he kept on gnawing.
Then Mary cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s your doll, Jan!”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Over in the grass behind Rover.”</p>

<p>And there was the missing Flo, not in the
least hurt, though there were some stains on
her dress, made by the grass and the greasy
ham bone.</p>

<p>“But we can play it’s Monday and have a
wash day,” said Mary. “We’ll wash her
clothes!”</p>

<p>Jan thought this would be fun.</p>

<p>“I guess the ham bone must have dropped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
out when Rover carried my doll as far as
this,” said Jan. “Then he let go of Flo and
began to gnaw Trouble’s bone. Oh, I wonder
what Trouble will do next!”</p>

<p>“He’s awful cute,” laughed Mary. “How
nicely he told us what he had done.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Trouble is good that way. He never
tries to get out of anything he does. Well,
I’m glad Flo isn’t hurt. Now let’s wash her
dress,” and the two little girls had as much
fun at this as they had had playing party.</p>

<p>So, after all, it was a good thing that
Rover carried off the doll with the ham bone
hidden under her dress. For if he had not
Trouble might have eaten too much. And
Mrs. Seaton said it made no difference to her—they
had other hams in the smoke-house.</p>

<p>Everyone at Cherry Farm laughed that
night when Jan came home and told what
had happened to her doll.</p>

<p>“I had a lovely time over at Mary’s,”
she said to her brother. “What did you do
at Jimmie Dell’s?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we made a big kite and we’re going
to fly it to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“May I come and see you?”</p>

<p>“Course you can! But don’t bring
Trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“’Cause he might get tangled in the tail
and sail up in the air.”</p>

<p>So Baby William was left with his mother
when Jan and Ted went over to Jimmie
Dell’s house the next day to fly the big kite.
It was quite a large one—almost as tall as
Ted himself—but as there was a good wind
the boys thought it would go up all right.
They tied the string to it, made the tail, and
then while Jimmie held it up off the ground
Ted ran, holding the ball of cord in his hand.</p>

<p>The kite went up a little distance in the
air, and then gave a sudden downward dive.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jan. “What
made it do that?”</p>

<p>“Not enough tail on,” answered Jimmie.
“Wait a minute, I’ll fix it.”</p>

<p>Not wanting to wait to get more string and
pieces of cloth from which the tail was made,
Jimmie fastened on a bunch of weeds he
pulled up from the spot where he was standing.</p>

<p>“That will make it heavier, and then the
kite won’t dip and dive,” he said. “All
ready now!” he called to Ted. “Start and
run!”</p>

<p>Ted ran, letting out string from the ball<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
he carried in his hand. The kite went up a
little way and then gave another sudden
dive, right down near a place where some
chickens and an old rooster were picking
bugs and worms from the grass. The chickens
gave frightened squawks and ran away
with fluttering wings.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried Jan, who was watching
the boys. “It’s going to come down again!”</p>

<p>But the kite did not. That one dive
seemed to be enough for it, as it at once began
to soar up in the air.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s going up! It’s going up!” cried
Jimmie.</p>

<p>“Run, Teddy, run!” called Jan.</p>

<p>And her brother did run.</p>

<p>The kite rose in the air until the long tail
was almost clear from the ground and then
the Curlytop girl saw a queer sight.</p>

<p>For, tangled in the weed which Jimmie
had tied on the end of the tail, was the rooster.
He was being raised up with the big
kite and his frightened crows and the flapping
of his wings showed that he did not like
it at all.</p>

<p>Up and up went the kite, and up and up
went the rooster!</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>A QUEER RIDE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted</span>, running as he was with the ball of
string, and with his back to the kite, did not
see what had happened. But he wondered
why Jan and Jimmie were shouting so
loudly.</p>

<p>“Look! Look! Look at the rooster!”
yelled Jimmie, jumping up and down, he was
so excited.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll fall and be killed!” exclaimed
Janet.</p>

<p>“Cock-a-doodle-do!” crowed the rooster
himself, while below him, running about on
the ground, the hens clacked and clucked,
wondering what it was all about, and thinking,
perhaps, that a big hawk had carried
off their friend.</p>

<p>“Stop, Ted! Stop!” Jimmie finally cried.
“That’s my father’s best rooster and he
wouldn’t want him hurt. Stop!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>Not until then did the Curlytop boy turn
around to see what was the matter. Then he
saw the rooster dangling in the air from the
weed that was on the end of the kite tail.</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” cried Ted. “How did it happen?”</p>

<p>Without waiting for anyone to answer
him he stopped running. The kite, no longer
being pulled against the wind, began to fall,
especially as the rooster was heavy. If it
had not been such a big kite it never would
have gone up with its long tail and the rooster
also.</p>

<p>But kites, in a strong wind, can lift heavy
weights. Ted had been told this by his
father, and that is why he and Jimmie made
such a large flier. But they never expected
it to lift a rooster.</p>

<p>“The string and the weed on the end of the
tail got tangled around Mr. Rooster’s legs,”
said Jimmie, when he and Ted went to where
the kite had fallen to look at it. “He
couldn’t get loose.”</p>

<p>And that is exactly what happened. The
rooster had been quietly feeding with the
hens when the weed, which Jimmie had
pulled up, roots and all, had flopped down on
him as the kite made a dive through the air,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
and then had come the sail upward, the rooster
getting a free ride.</p>

<p>With many a crow, and other queer noises,
the ruffled fowl ran away as soon as Jimmie
had untangled him. And such a cawing and
cackling as there was among the hens! If
chickens talk, as some people think they do,
they must have had lots of questions to ask
old Mr. Rooster about what had happened to
him when he was ballooning.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we’ll get this kite up in the
air after a while,” said Jimmie, when they
were once more ready. “Jan, you’d better
keep watch and see if we get tangled up with
any more things.”</p>

<p>“I will,” promised the little girl.</p>

<p>But nothing else happened, and this time
the kite went away up in the air, darting
here and there like some big bird. Ted and
Jimmie took turns holding the string, and
then they let Jan feel how strongly the kite
pulled.</p>

<p>Then they sent up “messengers”—bits of
paper, pierced with a hole so they could slide
up the slanting string, all the way to the kite
high in the air. The wind blew up the “messengers,”
and the two boys pretended they
were at war, and were generals sending word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
to their soldiers about the “enemy,” hidden
in the tall weeds.</p>

<p>Ted and Jimmie were sitting down in the
grass, watching the kite floating in the air
far above them, when Jan, who was tying
some leaves together to make a sort of baby
doll, called:</p>

<p>“Here comes Hal!”</p>

<p>The two boys looked up to see the lame
chap hopping toward them, a smile on his
face.</p>

<p>“I came over to see your kite,” he explained.
“I saw it from the field where I
was sitting, and I wondered who had it up
so high. It’s a dandy!”</p>

<p>“It’s higher than it was a while ago, when
it tried to take up our old rooster,” laughed
Jimmie.</p>

<p>“Take up a rooster? Oh, I’d like to see
that!” cried Hal.</p>

<p>“We give only one show like that a day,”
returned Ted, grinning. “You can hold the
kite awhile if you want to.”</p>

<p>“Thanks!” exclaimed the lame boy. “I
like kites. I can make ’em, only they don’t
have the right things over at the Home. I
can make a dandy one that goes up without
a tail.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“Can you?” cried Jimmie. “That’s
great! Make one, will you? I’ve got lots of
paper and sticks.”</p>

<p>So after Hal had held the kite with the tail
for a while, feeling how hard it pulled, the
children all went to the Dell home, and there
made a kite without a tail, Hal teaching his
new chums how to do it. There are only two
sticks used in a tailless kite, instead of three,
and the cross-stick is bent like a bow, and
held that way with a string before the paper
is pasted on.</p>

<p>It took the rest of that day to make the
kite without a tail, and then it was time for
Hal to go back to the Home. But he promised
to come the following day and see the
others fly it.</p>

<p>“I can hold it, while one of you runs with
the string,” explained the lame boy.
“Sometimes, if the wind is just right, you
don’t have to run with these kites at all.
They’re easier to fly than the others. You’ll
like ’em.”</p>

<p>“We’re glad you came over,” said Jimmie,
and he and Ted felt that, after all, it
was not so bad to be lame when one could
make such fine kites.</p>

<p>“Say, you’d better tell your grandmother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
to get her chocolate cake ready,” Hal called
to Ted just before starting away.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because that party, or entertainment, or
whatever you want to call it, that they’re
going to have to raise money for the Home
will be given in two weeks. I thought I’d
tell you in plenty of time, so your grandmother
wouldn’t have to hurry,” he added
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell her,” promised Ted. “Is there
anything I can do?”</p>

<p>“And me, too!” added Jan quickly. “I’d
like to help.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that there is,” answered
Hal slowly. “They’re trying to raise
money for the Home, that’s about all I
know.”</p>

<p>“We might sell lemonade,” said Jan,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I guess they’re going to sell lemonade
over at the Home,” explained Hal. “If I
hear of anything you can do I’ll let you
know.”</p>

<p>Jimmie and Ted, as well as Jan, were eagerly
waiting for Hal to come the next day
and show them how to fly the tailless kite.
He had promised to come right after breakfast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
but it was nearly noon when he reached
Jimmie’s house, and he hopped along slowly,
his face showing that he was in pain.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jan quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing much,” and he tried to smile.
“Dr. Wade played a sort of game of tag with
my bad foot this morning, and it—it—um—it
sort of—tickles,” he went on. “I don’t
mind, though, for it’s the only way to make
it straight and better, so I won’t have to
limp. There’s lots worse than me. Some of
’em can’t get out of bed after the nurses or
doctors give ’em what they call ‘treatment.’
That is they rub or twist the crooked bones.
But I’m lucky. I could get over here.”</p>

<p>It must have been painful for him, though
he said nothing about it. Hal was a brave
little chap.</p>

<p>“Now for the kite!” he cried gaily.
“There’s a good wind and it ought to sail up
fine!”</p>

<p>And so it did, going up much better and
easier than the one with the tail. And it
flew higher, too, and pulled much harder.</p>

<p>“I wish I had a kite of my own,” said
Janet wistfully, after she had been given a
few turns at holding the string of the boys’
kite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>“I’ll make you one,” promised Hal.
“It’ll be bigger than this, if I can get longer
sticks.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get ’em,” offered Jimmie, and this,
a few days later, he did. So Jan had her
kite, and it was a good flier, too.</p>

<p>“It’s more fun to play with this than with
a doll,” said the little Curlytop girl after
she and Ted had gone back to Cherry Farm.
“A kite does something, and a doll can’t unless
you do it for her.”</p>

<p>“If you hide a ham bone under her dress
a dog will carry her off,” said Grandpa Martin,
and the children laughed.</p>

<p>The Curlytops and their friends had fun
flying kites and doing many other things
during the vacation days at Cherry Farm.
One morning Ted called to his sister:</p>

<p>“I say, Jan, come on down to the brook-pasture,”
and he pointed toward a large
field, through which ran a little brook.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do down there?”
asked Jan.</p>

<p>“You’ll see,” answered her brother, and
Jan saw that he had a piece of clothesline
coiled under his blouse. “Come on, you’ll
see. I’m going to learn to be a Wild West
cowboy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“Oh, Ted! If mother heard you——”</p>

<p>“She won’t, if you don’t tell her. It’s no
harm. Come on!”</p>

<p>Eager to see what her brother would do,
Jan followed him. When she saw him
climbing the fence to get into the pasture,
and as she noticed some little calves eating
in the grass, she asked:</p>

<p>“Are you going to catch one?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to lasso it,” answered Ted.
“Wild West cowboys lasso.”</p>

<p>“Won’t it hurt the little cow?”</p>

<p>“Nope. I’ll do it easy. It won’t hurt.”</p>

<p>And I don’t believe it really did. Ted
climbed over the fence and, making a slip-noose
in the clothesline, he went up softly
behind one of the calves. But the animal
heard Teddy coming and, kicking up his
heels, ran away.</p>

<p>“But I’ll get another,” declared the little
Curlytop chap, and after two or three attempts
he did manage to throw the noose
over the neck of a small calf. The little animal
tried to pull away, but Ted was quite
strong and at last led the animal along by the
rope.</p>

<p>“Now I’m a cowboy!” boasted Ted.
“Didn’t I tell you I could catch one?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>“Yes,” agreed Jan, “you did. Is that all
you’re going to do?”</p>

<p>It really was not much fun for her to sit
on the fence and watch her brother lead a
calf around by a rope. The calf seemed
quite tame after it was once caught, and did
not try to get away.</p>

<p>“Maybe I could teach it to do tricks,”
said her brother. “If I could we might have
a circus and earn money for the Crippled
Home. Say, Jan——”</p>

<p>“Oh, here comes grandpa!” suddenly
called Janet, looking back across the field
from her seat on the fence. “You’d better
let that calf go!”</p>

<p>Ted thought so himself, and tried to get
the rope off the little animal’s neck. But it
was pulled tight, and as the calf kept jerking
its head Ted did not find it easy to loosen
the noose.</p>

<p>“Here, you help, Jan!” he begged. “I’ll
lead the calf up to you while you sit on the
fence, and you can hold him while I untie
the rope.”</p>

<p>Jan was willing, and they both worked
quickly, for they did not want Grandpa
Martin to see that they had caught a calf.
He might not like it, though really the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
animal was not hurt, and hardly even scared—at
least so the Curlytops thought.</p>

<p>“I can’t reach the rope if he keeps lifting
his head up that way,” said Ted, after a bit.
“Here, Jan, you hold the loose end, and I’ll
climb up on the fence. Then I can reach
down.”</p>

<p>Jan took the end of the rope and her
brother scrambled up on the rail fence. He
worked away at the knot around the calf’s
neck, and Jan looked back to see how near
Grandpa Martin was. The old gentleman
had turned to one side, however, and did not
seem to be coming to the pasture.</p>

<p>“There!” cried Ted. “I almost had it!”</p>

<p>And just then something happened. Ted
slipped from the fence, and, as he fell, he
stretched out his arms toward the calf in
front of him and down below him. Then
Ted fell astraddle right on the calf’s back,
just as if he intended to take a bareback
gallop.</p>

<p>The next minute he was having a queer
ride, for Janet, with a cry of surprise, had
let go her end of the rope, and the calf, with
Ted on his back, was running across the
field.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>GRANDPA IS WORRIED</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh</span>! Oh! Oh!” cried Janet, and she
was so surprised that she almost fell off the
fence. “Oh, The-o-dore Martin, what are
you doing?”</p>

<p>Janet did not really mean to ask that question,
for she could see plainly what her
brother was doing. He was riding a very
much frightened calf around the pasture,
though Ted, himself, did not want to do that
at all. And though the calf had not been
very much frightened when Ted lassoed it
by tossing the rope around its neck, the animal
was frightened now. Never before, in
all its short life, had anyone ridden on its
back.</p>

<p>“Jan! Jan!” cried Ted. “Go and get
grandpa and——”</p>

<p>That was all Ted’s sister heard, for, just
then, the calf turned and ran the other way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
and the wind carried Ted’s voice away from
Jan.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he wants grandpa to do?”
thought Janet. “I guess Ted wants him to
stop the calf from running away. For it <i>is</i>
running away!”</p>

<p>The calf certainly was! Of course it was
not running out of the field, for the pasture
was a large one with a fence all around it,
and the calf could not climb over the fence
nor break it down. But it was running here
and there—all about—and poor Ted was on
its back, clinging with both arms around the
calf’s neck so he would not fall off.</p>

<p>Excited as she was, Jan managed to hold
on to the fence, and look across Cherry Farm
to where she had last seen her grandfather
coming toward the pasture. But he had
turned aside and was now going toward the
cherry grove. He did not appear to have
seen Jan and Ted, nor anything of what had
happened.</p>

<p>“Oh, Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa!”
called Janet, as loudly as she could. “Teddy’s
running away with the calf—I mean the
calf is running away with Teddy! Oh, do
something! What shall I do? Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>But Grandpa Martin did not hear the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
Curlytop girl. He was too far away.
Teddy, too, was shouting, but his sister could
not hear what he said, as he was too far off.
And, as he was farther away from his grandfather
than was Jan, of course the farmer
could not hear the little boy either.</p>

<p>“Oh, what shall I do?” Janet asked
again, and she was almost ready to cry for
fear her brother would be hurt. Though he
was older than was she, still she felt she must
look after him almost as much as she took
care of Trouble—when Trouble let her.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked a voice behind
Janet, and, turning, she saw Hal Chester,
who had come up so quietly she had not
heard him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hal!” cried Janet, “Ted’s on the
calf’s back and he can’t get off, and I don’t
know how to stop him and I can’t make
grandpa hear and—and—— Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“My! that’s a lot of trouble!” said Hal.
“I’ll see if I can help. Where’s the calf
and where’s your grandfather?”</p>

<p>“There’s the calf,” and Janet pointed to
where it was racing around, its tail held high
in the air. “And grandpa is going to the
cherry grove, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think maybe I can stop the calf<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
without going after him, especially as it’s
so far, and my foot doesn’t feel very well to-day,”
said the lame boy. “Here he comes
now,” he went on, as he saw the calf with
Ted on its back swing around a corner of
the pasture and head toward Janet where she
still stood on the fence.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” she asked.</p>

<p>“When he comes near enough I’ll stand in
front of him, jump up and down and swing
my hat. I saw a man do that once to stop
a runaway horse and it worked fine. I guess
it’ll be the same with a runaway calf.”</p>

<p>“Did the horse have anybody on its
back?” Janet demanded.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so. But that doesn’t
make any difference. Here he comes now.
I’ll see what I can do.”</p>

<p>Hal climbed over the fence, and stood
ready to do as he had said he would. The
calf, with Ted still clinging to its neck, came
nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hal! Jan! Stop him! Stop him!”
cried the small Curlytop boy. “Get grandpa
or somebody and stop him. I’m all—all—shaken
up—to—to jel-ly!” and the words
seemed jarred out of poor Ted as you shake
corn out of a popper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“Hal’s going to stop him! Hal will stop
him!” shouted Jan.</p>

<p>The racing calf was now quite close to the
lame boy, who did not seem to be at all
afraid. He took off his cap and began waving
it around—up and down—every way.
At the same time he hopped up and down,
flapping his arms and shouting as loudly
as he could.</p>

<p>“Whoa there! Stop! Whoa!” yelled
Hal.</p>

<p>The calf still came on, but not quite so
fast. Of course it might have turned to
either side and gone past Hal, but maybe
the little animal did not think of this. It
slowed up, and did not seem to know what
to do.</p>

<p>“Jan, you jump down and hold out your
arms, too,” called Hal, and Jan did so. She
waved her hands and her sunbonnet, but she
forgot to jump up and down.</p>

<p>But this did not seem to be needed, for
now the calf, seeing the fence on one side of
him, and a very much excited boy and girl
directly in its path, came to a sudden stop.
It was going to turn and run back the other
way—any way at all to get rid of that
strange two-legged creature on its back.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
But the sudden stop did just what Jan and
Hal and what Ted himself and the calf
wanted—it took the Curlytop boy off the
little animal’s back.</p>

<p>Ted slid off and fell to the ground. But
as the grass was soft and long he was not
a bit hurt, seeming to bounce up as though
he had ridden on a load of hay or had fallen
in the feather bed which Trouble had cut
with the scissors.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad!” cried Jan, as she ran
to her brother. “Are you hurt?”</p>

<p>“I—I guess not. Nope!” he answered,
as he felt of his arms and legs. “I’m much
obliged to you for stopping him, Hal.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it was easy. How’d you come
to get on his back?”</p>

<p>“I was playing cowboy.”</p>

<p>“Cowboys don’t ride calves,” declared
Hal.</p>

<p>“Well, then I was a calf-boy, I guess,”
and Ted laughed.</p>

<p>He was telling Hal how he had lassoed the
calf, which, by this time, had managed to
get the rope off its neck, when a voice called
to the children:</p>

<p>“What have you been doing?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” they exclaimed, like the chorus of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
a song; and, looking up, they saw Grandpa
Martin smiling at them from the other side
of the fence.</p>

<p>“Did anything happen?” asked the
farmer.</p>

<p>“I—I rode one of your calves,” answered
Ted. “But I—I didn’t mean to.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” said grandpa, and there was a
twinkle in his eyes. “Calves aren’t made to
ride. You might get hurt. Don’t do it
again.”</p>

<p>Of course Ted promised that he would not
and then, having picked up the piece of
clothesline, which he had used as a lasso, the
Curlytop boy, with his sister and the lame
boy, started back for the Cherry Farm
house with grandpa.</p>

<p>“I came over to ask Mrs. Martin to bake
a cake for the fair we’re going to have,”
said Hal to Ted’s grandfather. “Jan said
she’s made ’em before for the Home.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I guess she’ll make one this
time,” said Grandpa Martin slowly. “I’d
like to help some myself—giving money—but
this year I’m too poor, I’m sorry to say.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I guess somebody else will give
money,” said Hal cheerfully. “The chocolate
cake will be great.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“Will you get any of it to eat?” asked
Jan.</p>

<p>“Well, no, not exactly. You see folks bake
pies, cookies, cakes and so on, and they’re
sold to the visitors who come to the fair.</p>

<p>“The last fair they had the folks most generally
took the cakes they bought home with
’em, so we didn’t get any. But maybe it’s
better so,” he added, though he could not
help sighing a little. “We’re not supposed
to have much cake. The doctors and nurses
say it isn’t good for us.”</p>

<p>“I should think you could have a little!”
exclaimed Jan. “I know what I’m going to
do. I’m going to ask my mother to bake a
chocolate cake special for you, Hal Chester.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be fine!” laughed the lame boy.
“What I can’t eat I’ll give to some of the
other boys and girls.”</p>

<p>They walked on to the farmhouse, and the
Curlytops noticed that their grandfather
looked worried. They could tell this, as Jan
said afterward, because his face was just
like her father’s the time his store burned
down.</p>

<p>“I guess he’s worried ’cause he’s poor,”
whispered Ted.</p>

<p>“Or maybe the cherries aren’t getting ripe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
fast enough,” said Janet. So she asked:
“Grandpa, will the cherries soon be ready
to pick?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—yes—there’ll be plenty of cherries.”</p>

<p>“Then can’t you sell them for a bushel of
money?”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, I’m afraid I have too
many cherries. I never saw the trees so full
of them. I never had such a crop! The
only trouble will be to sell them before they
all spoil. I’m afraid I have too many—the
price will be very low. I won’t get much for
them. But don’t you little Curlytops bother
about me. I guess I’ll be all right, even if
I can’t give money to the Home as I’ve done
before. Don’t worry about me.”</p>

<p>But Ted and Jan did worry, even when
Grandma Martin not only promised to make
a big chocolate cake for the Home but also
one for Hal. Still the Curlytops did not see
what they could do to help.</p>

<p>“But when cherry-picking time comes we
can help cart ’em from the grove in the goat
wagon,” said Ted.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed his sister. “Let’s go for
a ride over there now, and see how long it
will be before they’re ripe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>This was a day or so after Ted had ridden
the calf.</p>

<p>“Me come!” cried Trouble, as he saw his
brother and sister getting Nicknack ready
for their drive.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I s’pose you’ll have to come,
Trouble!” replied Jan. “Come along!”</p>

<p>They rode down the shady highway in the
goat wagon, listening to the birds, watching
the bees and butterflies flutter from
flower to flower, and thinking how lovely it
was to spend a vacation at Cherry Farm.
The Curlytops had forgotten, for the time,
about the troubles and worries of Grandpa
Martin.</p>

<p>All at once, as they drove the goat wagon
around a turn in the road, the children saw,
just in front of them, a funny wagon,
painted red, and drawn by a white horse.
On the back step of the wagon, which looked
a little like those driven by gypsies, stood
a very fat man. He was so fat that it is a
wonder the wagon did not tip up, horse and
all, from his weight on the back step. But
perhaps it had extra heavy front wheels to
hold that end down to the ground.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! Oh, ho!” cried the fat man in a
jolly voice. “Oh, ho! What have we here?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
Gay travelers like myself! Oh, lollypops
and ice-cream sandwiches! That’s the rig
for me! I love a goat! I must have a goat!
I will buy yours. I’ll give you a thousand
gumdrops for him. Oh, ho! Sell me your
goat!”</p>

<p>And while the surprised Curlytop children,
with Jan holding Trouble in her lap,
stopped their goat, and looked at the funny
fat man in his funny red wagon, he looked
at them and laughed until his face was as
wrinkled as a toy circus balloon when the
wind hisses out of it. And then the fat man
cried again:</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! I love a goat! I will give you
my white horse and red wagon for your goat
and a million gumdrops besides. Come, let
us trade. Are you simple Simons with a
penny, or, indeed, have you any? Oh, ho! I
will sing!”</p>

<p>And then he began to sing:</p>

<small>TRYING TO EARN MONEY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Curlytops were so surprised they did
not know what to do. Even Trouble just sat
in Jan’s lap and stared at the funny fat man,
who, after he had finished the song, reached
somewhere inside his wagon, and pulled out
a freshly-ironed white coat, like those worn
by men in a barber shop.</p>

<p>This coat the fat man put on, taking off
the one he had been wearing, which, Ted saw,
had some black streaks on it, so that it was
not entirely clean.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho!” cried the fat man. “Now I am
ready for waffles! So you won’t sell me your
goat, nor trade him for my coat? Well,
maybe it is better so, and I need my clean
coat to wear as I bake the waffles. Oh, ho!”</p>

<p>“Do you s’pose he really wants our goat?”
asked Jan in a whisper of her brother.</p>

<p>“He can’t have him, if he does,” answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
the Curlytop boy. “We won’t sell Nicknack.”</p>

<p>“And we won’t trade him for a horse,
either,” went on Jan. “A horse is too big
for us. A goat is just right.”</p>

<p>But the jolly fat man did not seem to want
to take Nicknack away from the Curlytops.
He smiled at them, now that he had on his
clean coat, and then, going inside his wagon,
he took the reins and turned his horse
around so that the children could see the side
of the red and little house-like wagon. They
saw what seemed to be a tiny kitchen, with
shelves of dishes, and on a white oilcloth-covered
table stood a little gasolene stove.</p>

<p>The fat man mixed some batter in a pan,
lighted a fire in the small stove and then began
to cook something. As smoke arose and
a delicious, sweet, brownish smell filled the
air, the queer man began ringing a bell.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho!” he cried, laughing. “Do you
know what that means?”</p>

<p>“I knows! I knows!” cried Trouble before
his brother or sister could speak.
“Dat’s din’-don’ bell, Pussy’s in de well!”</p>

<p>“Almost right, little chap!” laughed the
man. “It is a ding-dong bell, but it sings
another song. Here it is,” and he sang:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Ding dong bell,</div>
<div class="verse">Listen while I tell,</div>
<div class="verse">Down in the dingle-dell,</div>
<div class="verse">Hot waffles do I sell!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>And with that the man did something to
the little stove on the white table in front of
him and, like the magician doing tricks, such
as taking a rabbit out of a hat, the man
clapped out on a plate some hot waffles, over
which he sprinkled powdered sugar.</p>

<p>“Here you are!” he cried. “Hot waffles
for a penny. Simple Simon’s pie! Oh, my
eye! Hot waffles high and dry! Want to
buy?” and he leaned down over the table in
the side of the red wagon and looked smilingly
at the children in the goat cart as the
store-keeper leans over his counter to hear
what the little girl says when her mother
sends her to the grocer’s for a yeast cake
and she buys a pound of sugar instead.</p>

<p>“Want to buy some waffles?” asked the
fat man.</p>

<p>“Are they really a penny?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“That’s all—no more, no less. A penny
apiece, ten cents a dozen.”</p>

<p>“We couldn’t eat a <i>dozen</i>,” said Jan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
wide-eyed. “Anyhow mother wouldn’t like
us to. But we could buy one apiece.”</p>

<p>“Then please do,” begged the fat man.
“I haven’t sold any since I left the last town,
and I’d like to make a start. Come, I’ll give
you each two for a penny, seeing you are my
first customers. Here you are,” and as
nimble as a cat when she’s jumping over a
fence to get away from the dog, the fat man
ran from his wagon, coming out of the little
door in the back, and stood bowing before
the children with the plate of hot waffles in
his hand.</p>

<p>“Here you are,” he cried. “Two for a
penny.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see,” said Ted slowly. “There’s
three of us. Trouble can eat two, I guess.
Three times two is seven——”</p>

<p>“No, <i>six</i>,” corrected Jan, for she was better
in number-work than was her brother.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, six,” agreed Teddy. “Six
waffles is three cents,” and from his pocket
he took three pennies which he gave to the
fat man, who put six waffles down on a piece
of paper in Jan’s lap.</p>

<p>“There you are!” he cried. “You’re the
little housekeeper, I guess. Now I’ll have
good luck—I’ve made my first sale!” and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
laughed so that he shook all over as if he
were a jelly lollypop.</p>

<p>“Do you go around selling hot waffles like
the man in our town?” asked Jan, as she
gave Trouble and Ted each one of the sugar-covered
cakes.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know the man in your town,
but I do go about selling them here—also
lollypops, popcorn balls, candy and other
things. Sometimes ice-cream when I’m in a
city where I can sell it before it melts. But
in the country like this I sell mostly
waffles.”</p>

<p>“And did you really want to take our
goat?” asked Jan anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, my dear. I was only joking. I do
love a goat, and I had one when I was a boy.
But I soon grew so fat that I had to pull him
around in the cart instead of his pulling me.
That was too hard work for me, so I waited
until I could buy a horse.”</p>

<p>“Could you ride your horse in your
wagon?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“No, I’m afraid not. I’ve too much in my
cart. I sleep in it. Come and look.”</p>

<p>Tying Nicknack near a fence, where he
could nibble the sweet grass, Jan and Ted,
taking Trouble by the hands, went to look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
at the fat man’s wagon. They finished eating
the waffles as they looked at it. The
wagon within was like a little house. There
was a bed built on one side, and a table with
books and papers on it. Then there was a
little kitchen, where the fat man cooked
waffles, and other things that he ate himself.</p>

<p>“You see I’d get sort of tired of waffles,
seeing so many of them,” he explained. “I
only eat ’em when I can’t sell ’em.”</p>

<p>Then he told the Curlytops how he drove
about from town to town in the country,
sometimes going to cities, where he sold
waffles and other things. His name, he said,
was Sam Sander, and he had been selling
waffles and candy about the country for
seven years.</p>

<p>“Well, I must be traveling on,” he said
after a while, when the Curlytops had finished
looking at his wagon, inside and outside.
“I’m going to town to sell waffles.
Here’s a little waffle for your goat,” and he
tossed a broken one to Nicknack, who ate it
and cried: “Baa-a-a-a!” as if in thanks.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he nice!” exclaimed Jan when
smiling Sam Sander had driven away with
his white horse and red wagon. “I like
him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“So do I,” agreed Ted.</p>

<p>“More cake?” asked Trouble, looking up
with his face quite smeared with the waffles
he had eaten.</p>

<p>“No more cakes now,” answered Jan with
a laugh. “But those were good,” she said to
her brother. “I’d like some more myself.”</p>

<p>“We’ll buy some to-morrow if we can find
him,” returned Ted. “If he’s going to be in
town we may see him. We can ride over in
our goat wagon.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Jan. “I’m glad Mr.
Sander didn’t take Nicknack even in fun,
though.”</p>

<p>“Huh, I wouldn’t let him!” cried Ted.
“Say!” he went on, “don’t you wish we
could ride around like that and sell things?”</p>

<p>“It would be nice,” agreed his sister.
“And, oh say, Ted! we could earn money that
way for the Home, where Hal lives.”</p>

<p>Her eyes sparkled and she clapped her
hands. Janet thought of more things than
Ted could keep track of sometimes.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t that be lovely?” she cried, her
eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>“It would be. But we’d have to have a
big wagon, and Nicknack couldn’t pull it,”
said Ted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“I wish there was some way we could earn
money and give it to the Home,” went on
Janet. “Baking chocolate cakes doesn’t
seem much.”</p>

<p>“Grandpa’d give ’em money if he had it,”
went on Ted.</p>

<p>“Yes; but he hasn’t it. He could give ’em
cherries, ’cause he has more than he can
sell,” said Janet. “But I guess cherries
wouldn’t be much good for the Home. Oh
dear, if we were only grown-up we could
help.”</p>

<p>Ted did not answer right away. He was
thinking very hard as he drove the goat
down the shady road. Then, all at once, he
cried:</p>

<p>“Janet, I know what we can do!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean to earn money. I know how we
can do it!”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Give goat rides. Don’t you know how
once, when we went to New York, in Central
Park we saw boys giving rides in goat wagons
for five cents apiece—I mean the rides
five cents apiece, not the wagons.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember.”</p>

<p>“Well, we could give rides to the boys and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
girls here, charge ’em money and give all we
got to the Home. Maybe it wouldn’t be
much, but it would be some.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ted! that’s just lovely!” cried Janet.
“We’ll do it! Oh, how nice it will be! Let’s
make a sign and put it on Nicknack.”</p>

<p>“How’re you going to put a sign on the
goat—paint him?”</p>

<p>“No. We’ll get mother to make one on
cloth, and we can pin the cloth to his harness,
and let it hang over his side like a blanket.”</p>

<p>“Say, that’s great!” cried Ted. “We’ll
do it!”</p>

<p>When the Curlytops told their mother and
father what they wanted to do—give goat
rides to earn money—everyone said it was
all right.</p>

<p>Mother Martin made a muslin sign, and
with some black paint found in grandpa’s
barn Daddy Martin painted the words.
They read:</p>

<p class="center">GOAT RIDES<br>
UP AND DOWN THE ROAD<br>
5 CENTS<br>
MONEY FOR THE CRIPPLED HOME</p>

<p>“There!” cried Ted, as he looked at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
sign hanging on either side of Nicknack,
“that ought to earn some money. Come on
now, Jan, we’ll go out and see what we can
do.”</p>

<p>“Oh but <i>we</i> can’t ride if we’re going to
take passengers!”</p>

<p>“No. But we can ride until someone
wants to get in, and then we can get out.
I’ll walk alongside the wagon and drive
Nicknack, and you can be the conductor and
collect the money.”</p>

<p>“All right. And if only one or two want
to ride at once we can get in too, for there’s
room.”</p>

<p>“All right! But come on! Now we can
earn money for Hal’s home!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>JIMMIE HAS A TUMBLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Down</span> the road trotted Nicknack, while
Ted and Jan sat on the front seat of the
wagon and looked eagerly ahead for the first
sight of some boy or girl to whom they might
offer a ride, and so earn money for the Crippled
Children’s Home where Hal Chester
hoped to have his lame foot cured.</p>

<p>“See anybody, Jan?” asked Ted, after a
bit.</p>

<p>“Nope! Do you?”</p>

<p>“Nope; but I hear someone calling. It’s
behind us. Maybe somebody wants a ride.
Listen!”</p>

<p>Somebody did. But when Jan and Ted
looked around they both laughed and cried
out:</p>

<p>“Trouble!”</p>

<p>And Trouble it was, toddling along after
the goat wagon, and calling as he hurried on:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“Waits a minute! Waits a minute! I
wants a wide!”</p>

<p>“What’ll we do?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve got to take him with us, I
s’pose,” replied Janet. “But if he rides
there’ll be that much less room for someone
else, and then we can’t earn as much money.”</p>

<p>Ted thought this over for a minute.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we could do,” he said,
as he stopped Nicknack and let the goat eat
the sweet grass that grew beside the road.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Janet.</p>

<p>“We could let whoever wanted to ride
hold Trouble on his lap. Then he wouldn’t
take up any room.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. But maybe they wouldn’t
want to hold him. Trouble is awful heavy
sometimes, and he does wiggle and squirm a
lot!”</p>

<p>“Well, if some of ’em didn’t want to hold
him they could pay a penny more and Trouble
could sit in a seat by himself.”</p>

<p>“That’s so!” cried Jan. “Then we’d
make a little extra money out of Trouble.”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” agreed her brother. “And
if they wanted to hear him, Trouble could
sing his funny little song for them.”</p>

<p>Janet laughed at this. Mother Martin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
had taught the little baby a queer mixture of
Mother Goose verses, and Trouble sang these
in a funny, squeaky voice—that is, he sang
when he wanted to.</p>

<p>“But it would be just like him not to sing
if someone asked him to,” sighed Janet.
“Then we’d have to let them ride free if
they didn’t want to hold the baby.”</p>

<p>“If Trouble won’t sing he can’t ride,” decided
Ted. “Here, Trouble!” he called to
his little brother. “Will you sing the
Crumpled-Cow-Jack-Horner-Pie-song if I
let you ride?”</p>

<p>“I will sing it two times,” said Trouble
earnestly. “I do want a wide. I runned
after you to hab a wide.”</p>

<p>“All right—hop in,” returned Ted; and
with their baby brother on the seat between
them Ted and Jan drove off again.</p>

<p>They had not ridden far before they came
to where Jimmie Dell lived. Jimmie was
swinging on his front gate, and as he saw
the goat wagon coming up with his three
little friends in it, he called:</p>

<p>“Where you goin’? Give us a ride, will
you?”</p>

<p>“We will for a penny,” answered Ted.</p>

<p>“A penny!” cried Jimmie, who had always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
before ridden for nothing behind
Nicknack.</p>

<p>“You see,” explained Janet, “we’re trying
to make money for the Home where Hal
lives. We’ll ride you down the road and up
again for five cents, or give you a little ride
for a penny.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll be in the wagon all by yourself,”
went on Ted. “I’ll get out and walk,
and Jan will be conductor and collect the
fare. Come on!”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to hold Trouble on your lap,
though,” said Janet; “but he’ll sing for you,
so you won’t mind holding him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll sing now!” decided Trouble, and he
began to croon:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“‘Once a crumpled bossy-cow,</div>
<div class="verse">Was eatin’ some gween cheese!</div>
<div class="verse">Dack Horner dropped his Twistmas pie</div>
<div class="verse">An’ made Bo Peep to sneeze!’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“There’s a lot more verses like that,” explained
Ted, as Trouble stopped singing to
catch his breath. “You’ll like it. Won’t he,
Jan?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!”</p>

<p>“I’d like a ride, too,” said Jimmie, “only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
I haven’t got five cents, or even a penny.”</p>

<p>Janet and Ted looked thoughtful on hearing
this. Then Janet said:</p>

<p>“Say, Ted, I think we ought to let Jimmie
have the first ride for nothing.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, ’cause it will give us a start. You
see if some other boys and girls see him riding
they’ll want to ride too, and it will be a
sort of advertisement for us.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it would. Come on, Jimmie.
You get in and I’ll walk along ’side the
wagon and drive Nicknack. Janet will be
conductor and make-believe she’s collected
your fare. Then it will look as if we had
made a start.”</p>

<p>“Do I have to hold Trouble?” asked
Jimmie.</p>

<p>“Course,” decided Ted. “He can’t walk.
But you don’t have to hear him sing if you
don’t want to, or he can sit beside you if you
don’t want to hold him. Only don’t let him
fall.”</p>

<p>“I’s goin’ to sing,” declared Baby William,
and he began on the tenth or maybe the
fifteenth verse. Sometimes he put the first
and last verses together and made an entirely
new one, so one never could tell when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
the song ended except when Trouble stopped
singing.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you can sing, and you can sit on
the seat next to me,” said Jimmie. “I’m
much obliged for the ride.”</p>

<p>“You’re an advertisement like a newspaper,”
explained Janet.</p>

<p>“And I think he ought to sort of holler
out like, and say what a fine ride he was
havin’ so’s more would come,” went on Ted.
“We’ve got to make money somehow.”</p>

<p>“I’ll holler,” promised Jimmie.</p>

<p>So, as he rode in the goat wagon, with
Trouble on the seat beside him, while Teddy
drove and Janet tried to look as if she had
collected her first fare, Jimmie called out:</p>

<p>“Come on and ride, everybody! It’s
great! A penny for a little ride, a nickel for
a bigger! Come on! Come on! Come on
and ride!”</p>

<p>His shouts, the painted sign on Nicknack,
the voice of Trouble singing his queer song
now and then, and Jan and Ted walking beside
the goat wagon drew the attention of the
few people they passed on the country road.</p>

<p>But none of them seemed to want a ride,
and at the few houses they passed, though
some children came to the gates and looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
very much as though they would like to ride,
they shook their heads, for they had no
money—not even a penny.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m havin’ lots of fun,” said
Jimmie, after a while. “But maybe I’d
better——”</p>

<p>Just then Nicknack saw a bunch of green
grass beside the road he thought he would
like to chew. He made a sudden jump for
it, and so quickly that Jimmie toppled off
the seat backward and fell with a “ker-thump”
on the grass beside the road.</p>

<p>“Whoa!” called Ted.</p>

<p>“Look out for Trouble!” exclaimed Jan.</p>

<p>Baby William, too, had tumbled off the
seat when Jimmie had fallen, but Trouble
only rolled to the bottom of the wagon, and
there he stayed, on his back, his eyes wide
open looking up at the sky.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt, Baby?” asked Jan, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Nope,” answered Trouble. “Did de goat
runned away?”</p>

<p>“No, he only gave a jump and Jimmie fell
out,” answered Ted. “Are you hurt,
Jimmie?” he asked the other boy.</p>

<p>“Nope! Not a bit, Teddy! I’m used to
tumbles like that. The grass is as soft as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
haystack. But I guess I’ve had enough ride.
I’ve got to go to the store for my mother.
Good-bye!” and he ran off down the road.
“Thanks!” he called back, over his shoulder,
almost forgetting this part of it. “I had a
dandy ride, and I wish I had some money
to give you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” answered Ted,
putting Trouble up on the seat again.</p>

<p>And he and Jan walked on beside Nicknack,
hoping someone with even a penny
would hail them and ask for a ride.</p>

<p>When the wagon came to the house in
which Mary Seaton lived, she was out in the
front yard.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mary!” cried Jan, “don’t you want
a ride?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I do!” answered the little girl.
And out she ran and got in the seat.</p>

<p>“Does I hab to sing for her?” asked
Trouble.</p>

<p>“What does he mean by singin’?” asked
Mary.</p>

<p>“Like dis,” explained Trouble. “I likes
you, Mary, so I sings.” And he started all
over again at the first verse. Mary liked the
song so much that she had Trouble sing it all
the way through. By this time she had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
given a ride quite a way down the road, and
then as Ted turned the goat around Mary
seemed to notice, for the first time, that Jan
and Ted were walking.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you ride?” she asked.
“There’s room.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we have had lots of rides,” explained
Jan. “Besides you’re our first regular passenger.
You can give me your five cents now
if you want to.”</p>

<p>“My five cents?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Your fare. Didn’t you see the sign?”
and Jan pointed to the one on Nicknack’s
side.</p>

<p>“Oh! Why, I haven’t any money!” cried
Mary. “I’ll have to get right out! I
thought you were <i>asking</i> me to ride as you
often do.”</p>

<p>“We’re trying to make money for the
Crippled Home,” explained Janet. “But I
guess we won’t take in much, Ted.”</p>

<p>“No. I guess not,” and her brother sadly
shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to sing again!” announced
Trouble. “You mus’ all lis-ten!”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Janet</span> and the others laughed when Baby
William finished his funny little song, Mary
joining in, though she looked a bit ashamed
when she thought of having taken a ride
without paying for it.</p>

<p>“But really I didn’t mean to,” she said.
“I never read the sign on your goat. I
thought it was a new kind of summer blanket
to keep off the flies.”</p>

<p>“Oh well, it’s all right,” replied Janet
kindly. “I guess maybe we can get somebody
else to ride and pay pennies.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask my mother for some,” offered
Mary.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Don’t!” begged Janet. “It’s
all right! We gave you the ride for nothing,
and it would be Indian-giving to take money
now.”</p>

<p>“My mother’s going to do something for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
the Home when it has the fair,” announced
Mary.</p>

<p>“That’ll be nice,” remarked Ted slowly,
but he was thinking of something else. “I
guess we’ll have to go away far off, where
nobody knows us, and give rides for five
cents and a penny,” he added more briskly.</p>

<p>“Go away off?” asked Janet wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, off on some other road. Here we
know everybody, and course we were glad
to give Mary and Jimmie rides, but
that isn’t makin’ money,” went on Ted earnestly.
“You see if we came to somebody
we didn’t know we wouldn’t mind askin’
’em to pay, like the waffle and lollypop man
did us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did you meet him?” asked Mary.
“Isn’t he nice? He comes every year, and
he’s always the same. I like him!”</p>

<p>“We liked his waffles!” laughed Ted.
“But what’ll we do, Jan?”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have to go a little farther
from here to get money for the Home,”
agreed his sister. “And maybe folks what
haven’t heard Trouble’s song so often would
give pennies to hear him sing.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Teddy. He was not quite
sure about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“Well, I’m much obliged for my ride,”
put in Mary. “And I’ll give you for the
Home the first penny I get.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” answered Jan. “Now we’ll
ride ourselves;” and she got in the seat when
Mary got out, while Ted took his place in
front and then, Jan holding Trouble, away
started the Curlytops once more to see what
they could do to help Hal and the other little
lame boys and girls by making the Home,
where they spent so many sad months, a
little happier place.</p>

<p>Janet and Teddy were so deeply interested
in getting to some stretch of road where
they were not known, so that they might ask
strange children to have goat rides, and
charge for them, that they never thought of
sending word back to Cherry Farm that they
were going off farther than they usually did.
They just drove Nicknack on and on, away
from the little village of Elmburg near
which Grandpa Martin lived, out past Clover
Lake and on to a strange country road that
led through the woods.</p>

<p>“There’s a house and some children playing
in the yard,” said Janet as they came
within sight of a large white farmhouse.
“Let’s ask if they don’t want a ride.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>The way in which two boys and three girls
crowded to the fence as the goat wagon drove
up seemed to show that the children did want
a ride very much.</p>

<p>“Down the road and back for five cents,”
explained Ted, as he pointed to the sign on
Nicknack’s side, while the goat ate grass.
“Or you can have a short ride for a penny.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go and ask my mother,” said the
oldest girl. “Now don’t any of you dare go
outside the fence!” she warned the others—her
smaller brothers and sisters it seemed.
“If you do a gobile might hit you.”</p>

<p>“What’s a gobile?” asked Janet.</p>

<p>“It’s what he calls an automobile,” explained
the older girl, and she pointed to a
small boy about the size of Trouble.</p>

<p>She hurried into the house, the others,
meanwhile, looking eagerly through the
fence palings at the goat and wagon. Jan
and Ted had gotten out, ready for business
in case this family of boys and girls wanted
a ride.</p>

<p>“Maw gimme a quarter,” explained the
girl when she came hurrying back, “and she
says will you give us all a ride down the road
and back and keep us out half an hour so she
can git some rest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>“All right,” said Janet. “We’ll give you
a nice ride for twenty-five cents. But will
you let my little brother stay in the wagon
with you? He’s too small to walk and we
can’t leave him.”</p>

<p>“Sure he can come,” said the girl, whose
hair was almost red. “I’ll hold him on my
lap. I’m used to children.”</p>

<p>“If you hold him maybe he won’t sing,”
Ted told her.</p>

<p>“Sing? Oh, I don’t mind singin’. I like
it!” said the almost red-haired girl with a
laugh. “Our Babs sings lots, though we
never can tell what he’s sayin’,” and she
pointed to the smallest child.</p>

<p>“I will not sing!” decided Trouble, with a
little stamp of his foot. “I will <i>not</i> sing
’less I wide on Nicknack’s back!”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t do that,” stated Ted.
“Get in now, everybody,” he went on, “and
we’ll give you a good ride.”</p>

<p>“Here’s your quarter,” said the girl, who
was taller than Jan. “Better take it ’fore I
lose it. I’m always losin’ somethin’. Maw
says I’d lose my head if it wasn’t fast.
Shouldn’t much mind though. I hate red
hair. Don’t you?” she asked Janet fiercely.</p>

<p>“Not when it’s the color yours is,” answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
Ted’s sister. “I think it’s lovely!”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you?” and the other girl, whose
name was Maude, smiled and seemed
pleased. “I like curls best, like yours.”</p>

<p>“They’re too tangly,” announced Janet,
shaking her head.</p>

<p>“Well, this is a start!” exclaimed Ted as
his sister put in her pocket the twenty-five
cent piece—the first money they had earned
for the Home.</p>

<p>The Curlytops gave the Pratt children—that
was the name of the family—a good long
ride down the road and back. They kept
them out over an hour, for when Ted would
have driven back to the yard to let off his
passengers Jan whispered to him to keep on
so Mrs. Pratt could have her half-hour rest.
It was very hard to tell whether a half-hour
or fifteen minutes or an hour had gone by.</p>

<p>Trouble, too, got over his fit of sulks and
sang his funny song, much to the delight of
Maude and her brothers and sisters. Babs,
the Pratt baby, also sang and he and Trouble
gave a sort of duet which sounded very
strange, as each one tried to sing louder than
the other, and no one could tell what either
said.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d come over to-morrow,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
Maude, when, at last, the goat ride was over.
“I think maw’ll give another quarter to be
quiet.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” half-promised Jan. “We
want to make all the money we can as
Grandpa Martin is poor, and he can’t give
as much as he has before to the Crippled
Home. His crops failed.”</p>

<p>“All but cherries,” explained Ted. “He’s
got bushels of them!”</p>

<p>“I wish we had,” said Maude. “I love
cherries.”</p>

<p>Once more the Curlytops drove on down
the road. It was not late yet, and Ted
wanted to see if he could not earn more
money. They passed several houses, some
where there were children, but none of them
had any money to pay for rides. At one
place, though, where a little boy was playing
with a nurse maid in the front yard they
were called to by the boy’s mother, who engaged
Ted to drive the little fellow up and
down, with the nurse to hold him, and when
the ride was over, at which the little boy
cried, the lady gave Janet fifty cents.</p>

<p>“Oh, but it isn’t worth that much—not
such a short ride,” Janet said.</p>

<p>“I’m giving the money to the Home,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
the lady softly. “I had another little boy—once.
I haven’t him now,” and she took
up the small lad whom the nurse was holding
and pressed him closely in her arms.</p>

<p>“Whew! what a lot of money we have!”
cried Ted, as he turned Nicknack toward
Cherry Farm a little later. “Seventy-five
cents! You’d better tie it in your handkerchief,
Jan, and then tie the handkerchief on
your neck so you won’t lose it.”</p>

<p>“Can’t tie my handkerchief on my neck.
It’s too little. But I’ll put it in my pocket—it’ll
be all right there;” and this she did.</p>

<p>They were now on the road that led
through the woods, and they were talking
so earnestly about how surprised those at
home would be over the seventy-five cents,
and Trouble was singing his Mother Goose
song so loudly, that none of them—especially
Jan and Ted—noticed when Nicknack
left the main road and turned into a side
path that led beneath the trees.</p>

<p>It was not until the wagon got clear off
even the side path and nearly upset, because
the goat pulled it over a big tree root, that
Ted called: “Whoa!” and looked about him.</p>

<p>“Why! Why!” he exclaimed. “Where
are we?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>“In the woods,” answered Janet calmly.</p>

<p>“I know—yes. But <i>what</i> woods? We
didn’t come here before.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a short cut to Cherry Farm,”
said his sister.</p>

<p>Ted looked all about him. He could see
nothing in the woods that he had ever seen
before, not a house or a barn was in sight.</p>

<p>“Janet,” he said, and he spoke in a whisper,
half afraid Trouble would hear and be
frightened, “Jan, we—we’re lost!”</p>

<p>“Lost? In these woods?”</p>

<p>“Yep! We’re lost!” and Ted got down
out of the wagon and tied Nicknack to a
tree.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>THE LOLLYPOP MAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">What</span> you doin’ that for?” asked Jan, as
she saw her brother knotting the rope that
was fast to the goat’s horns: “What you
making it so tight for?”</p>

<p>“So Nicknack won’t walk off. I don’t
want him to be any more lost than he is.”</p>

<p>“Really are we lost, Ted?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you guess so?”</p>

<p>Jan looked about among the trees. It did
seem as though they were a great way from
Cherry Farm. They could see no houses or
barns. There was no sign of a regular road,
such as the one on which carriages and automobiles
were wont to pass. And it was very
still and quiet in the woods. It was getting
dark, too!</p>

<p>“What—what are we goin’ to do?” asked
Janet.</p>

<p>Though she was used to looking after her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
brother, and doing things for him, even if he
was a year older than herself, still now she
turned to him for comfort. She wanted to
know what he was going to do.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know the way back home?”
asked Janet, anxiously.</p>

<p>Ted shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>“Nope,” he answered. “Do you?”</p>

<p>Janet shook her head, sadly this time.</p>

<p>“You playin’ a game?” asked Trouble.
“I want to play, too. I’s twired ob singin’!”</p>

<p>“I should think you would be!” exclaimed
Janet, putting her arms around him as he
sat in the goat wagon. “Oh, Trouble! If we
shouldn’t ever get back home again!”</p>

<p>“I want to be home <i>now</i>! I’s hungry!”
cried Baby William.</p>

<p>Ted and Jan looked at one another. This
was one bad thing about being lost—the getting
hungry part. Of course there were
other bad parts, too—such as being out alone
in the dark, not having a nice bed in which
to cover up to go to sleep.</p>

<p>“Course, leaves are all right to sleep in
when you’re camping,” said Teddy. “But
we’re not camping <i>now</i>.”</p>

<p>This was after he and Jan had looked
about in the woods hoping to find a path<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
that would take them back to the main road
that led to Cherry Farm.</p>

<p>But they had not found the path. Nicknack
had wandered far into the woods just
as it pleased him to go, and he had not kept
track of the way he had come. Before Jan
or Ted had noticed him he had strayed very
far from the path. Now he could not find
it again. Nicknack was not like a dog or a
cat which could find its way home again,
sometimes when it had gone miles and miles
away.</p>

<p>“I’s hungry!” announced Trouble again.
“I want some tookies!”</p>

<p>“What’ll we do?” asked Janet. “We
haven’t any to give him.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s in my Muvver Hubbard song,
about her dog an’ ze bone!” wailed Trouble.
“But I don’t want ze bones—I want ze
tookies!”</p>

<p>“I wish I had one for you, Trouble, dear,”
said Jan. “But there isn’t a one left.” She
looked in a little box under the seat, a box
Grandpa Martin had made for the children
to use as a sort of lunch basket. They often
put pieces of cake or some cookies in it, or
even sandwiches which their mother or
Grandma Martin made for them, if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
were to go on a long ride. But now only a
few cookie crumbs in a paper bag were all
Janet found.</p>

<p>“I wants more!” cried Trouble, when he
had hungrily eaten these. “I wants more!”</p>

<p>“Ted, we’ll just <i>have</i> to find the way
home,” said his sister.</p>

<p>“I wish I could,” he answered slowly. “It
wouldn’t be so bad if we were campin’ out,
for then we’d have <i>somethin’</i> to eat. We
are goin’ campin’ with grandpa some day,”
he went on. “He said so—on Star Island,
maybe. But then we’ll have lots to eat, and
we won’t mind if we’re lost.”</p>

<p>“Well, I mind it <i>now</i>, and so does Trouble!”
declared Jan. “Let’s look again for
the way home.”</p>

<p>They left Nicknack tied, and, holding the
hands of Trouble, the two Curlytops wandered
about in the woods. They took care
not to go too far away from the goat wagon,
for they did not want to lose sight of that.
Such a thing must never happen. The goat
did not seem worried. He nibbled bits of
grass, leaves and ferns and then knelt down
and stretched out on his side and seemed to
go to sleep.</p>

<p>“It must be gettin’ night,” said Jan in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
whisper, as they came back, not having found
anything that looked like a path.</p>

<p>“It isn’t very dark,” answered Ted hopefully.</p>

<p>“No. But see, Nicknack’s going to bed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well he often sleeps in the daytime,”
went on her brother. “Anyhow it’s dark
because there’s so many trees in the woods.
If we could get out on the road it would be
light.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t find our way out,” said
Janet, and her voice shook a little. “If we
go too far we’ll get more lost than ever.
Oh dear! I wish we hadn’t come! I want
mother and daddy and grandma and grandpa.
I want to go home!”</p>

<p>“Maybe they’ll come looking for us,” said
Ted eagerly.</p>

<p>“They won’t know where to find us.”</p>

<p>“We can holler! Come on! Let’s do
that!”</p>

<p>Jan and Ted made their voices sound as
loudly as they could in calls that echoed
through the woods. Trouble, too, joined in,
sometimes singing his funny song.</p>

<p>“Here we are! Here we are!” cried Jan
and Ted.</p>

<p>But, though they called and shouted no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
one seemed to hear them. Every once in a
while they would stop and listen, but they
heard no answer. The only noises were the
country sounds—the fluttering of the birds
through the trees, with now and then a song
from one of the feathered creatures. The
leaves blew in the wind, making a rustling,
and sometimes, when the bushes moved,
Trouble would hide behind Jan, for he was
afraid.</p>

<p>“Oh, what shall we do?” asked Jan, half
ready to cry, while it seemed to grow darker
in the woods. “We are truly lost, Ted, and
what <i>shall</i> we do? Look, Nicknack is fast
asleep!”</p>

<p>The goat’s eyes were closed. He had
eaten his supper and gone to sleep. He was
not worried about being lost. Any place was
home to him if his friends, the Curlytops,
were there. But it was different with the
children.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we’ll do,” said Ted, at
length.</p>

<p>“What?” asked his sister.</p>

<p>“We’ll holler a little more, and then, if
no one answers us, we’ll start and go.”</p>

<p>“Where will we go to?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. We’ll go any way at all.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
We’ll be sure to get somewhere, and maybe
somebody will find us and take us home.
Come on now, let’s all holler real loud.”</p>

<p>They got no answer, however; so presently
Teddy awakened the goat, the children got
into the wagon and let Nicknack draw them
along through the wood. It was an uncomfortable,
rough ride, however, over tree roots
and ruts, and after a while the children
stopped the goat and got out once more.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s holler again,” suggested
Teddy.</p>

<p>“And you sing, Trouble,” begged Jan.
“Sing real loud!”</p>

<p>“Don’t want to. I’se twired of singing!”</p>

<p>“Then cry. Maybe you’ll make more
noise that way.”</p>

<p>And cry Trouble did, loudly wailing, while
Jan and Ted shouted at the tops of their
voices and the bottoms too, as Ted said
afterward.</p>

<p>“Hello! Hello! Hello!” they cried.
“Hello!”</p>

<p>Hark! What was that? Some one answering?
Surely yes!</p>

<p>Through the woods came a voice:</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! Oh, ho! I love a goat! Some
day I will get me a goat! I will feed him on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
lollypops and soap! Oh, ho for a goat!
Oh, ho!”</p>

<p>Ted and Jan looked at one another. Then
they both cried joyfully:</p>

<p>“The lollypop man! It’s the lollypop
man!”</p>

<p>And so it was. Through the trees they
saw his red wagon and white horse going
along what must have been a woodland road.</p>

<p>“Here we are! Here we are!” cried Jan.</p>

<p>“Over here!” added Ted. “We’re not
lost any more! The lollypop man has found
us!”</p>

<small>CHEWING CHERRY CANDY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Well</span>, well! What have we here?”
asked Mr. Sam Sander, the hot waffle and
lollypop man, as he saw the rather tumbled-about
and frightened Curlytop children running
toward him. “What’s it all about?”</p>

<p>“We’re lost!” explained Jan.</p>

<p>“We were,” added her brother. “Not any
more.”</p>

<p>“And I singed, I did,” put in Trouble.
“Only I’s twired an’ I wants dubby-dubby
now.”</p>

<p>“He means he’s tired and hungry,” explained
Jan.</p>

<p>“Well, well! This is too bad!” said the
kind lollypop man. “How did it happen?”</p>

<p>“Nicknack, our goat, lost us,” declared
Ted. “He’s over there under the trees. But
we heard you singing and came to you.”</p>

<p>“And I’m glad you did,” said Mr. Sander.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
“I was singing because I’ve sold most of my
lollypops. But I have a few waffles left and
you hungry ones shall eat them. Oh, ho! I
don’t love a goat if he loses little children!”
he sang. “I don’t love bad goats!”</p>

<p>“Oh, it wasn’t Nicknack’s fault,” said
Jan earnestly. “We had him out, giving
rides to make money for the Home, and we
got seventy-five cents!”</p>

<p>Then as they ate the waffles, hot off the
griddle, they told Mr. Sander what had happened.
He went back with them to get Nicknack
and led the goat to the waffle wagon.
He was tied fast to the rear end, and then
the children, getting into the little house on
wheels, were soon driven back to Cherry
Farm.</p>

<p>“Oh, where <i>have</i> you Curlytops been?”
asked Mother Martin. “We have all been
<i>so</i> worried about you! And grandpa is just
starting to get some men to help find you.”</p>

<p>“The lollypop man found us,” said Jan.
“We’re sorry, but we didn’t mean to get
lost. Oh, we had ever so many adventures!”</p>

<p>And she and Ted told them all, while
Trouble fell asleep in his mother’s arms as
grandpa came back, glad he did not have to
hunt for the lost children. The lollypop man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
told how he happened to be taking a short
cut through the woods, or he never would
have passed the place where the Curlytops
were lost in the woods. By a mere chance
he found them.</p>

<p>So everything came out all right you see,
and when a few days later, Jan and Ted
gave the seventy-five cents to Hal to take to
the Home, the lame boy brought back a letter
of thanks from the manager.</p>

<p>“We’re going to have the fair next week,”
Hal said. “And right after that Dr. Wade
is going to make my foot all better.”</p>

<p>“Will you walk—different then?” asked
Ted.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll walk just like you, I guess. But
of course not at first. It’s got to get well
after the doctor does something to it. Will
you come to the fair?”</p>

<p>The Curlytops said they would, and
Mother Martin promised to take them.
There were busy times at Cherry Farm, for
the cakes were to be baked as Grandma
Martin had promised. Mother Martin made
some also. And what a crowd of people came
to see the lame boys and girls. They also
came to buy the candy, cakes and other
things the people gave for the helpless ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>“Are you making a lot of money?” asked
Mother Martin of Mrs. Burr, the woman who
had charge of the fair.</p>

<p>“Not as much as we would like to,” she
answered. “We hoped to make enough to
pay for having made the Home larger, but I
fear we shall not. We will need about a
hundred dollars more, and I do not see where
we are to get it. Everyone has given all
he can.”</p>

<p>“Grandpa Martin would give the hundred
dollars if he could,” said Jan who, with her
mother, heard what was said. “But he lost
lots of his money.”</p>

<p>“I know, my dear,” replied Mrs. Burr
with a smile. “Your grandfather has always
been kind and good to us. Perhaps
next year he will be able to help us more.”</p>

<p>There was a good time at the Home fair,
even if not as much money was made as was
hoped for. The crippled children, many of
whom were given rides in the Curlytops’
goat wagon, were glad to see so many visitors,
and Hal took great pride in showing
Jan and Ted around the place, and explaining
everything.</p>

<p>“I know lots about it,” he said, “’cause
I’ve been here longest. But if I get well I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
have to go away and I’ll miss being here.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll be well,” said Jan. “Won’t
that be fine!”</p>

<p>“Yes. But I wish everybody here would
be well,” said Hal softly. “Maybe they will
when they get some new machines for making
crooked legs and feet straight.”</p>

<p>At one end of the long hall where the fair
was being held, a booth, or curtained-off
place, had been set up for a Punch and Judy
show. This was to amuse the children who
came with their parents, and the little tots,
as well as some of the older boys and girls,
had laughed at the funny way Mr. Punch
whacked everyone with his stick, and then
cried, in his squeaky voice:</p>

<p>“That’s the way to do it! That’s the way
I do it!”</p>

<p>The man giving the Punch and Judy
show had gone through several performances,
as different crowds came and went,
and now it was time for another.</p>

<p>“Let’s go down again and listen to him,”
said Janet to Hal and Ted, as they stood
talking together at the other end of the room.
“I like to hear the funny, squeaky voice of
Mr. Punch.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Teddy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>“It’s like some of the fairy stories I like
to read,” said Hal in a low voice. “It comes
out that way, lots of times.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” asked Janet.</p>

<p>“Oh, everybody gets whacked so much,
and pounded and yelled at, and then, after
a while, they have it easy and the one that
hits them is sorry. That’s the way it is with
Mr. Punch. He gets sorry after a while.”</p>

<p>“He gets sorry after he’s scared a whole
lot,” said Janet, who had watched the little
show twice. “Anybody can be good when
they’re scared.”</p>

<p>“Grandpa’s hired man was scared when
Nicknack, our goat, got loose the first day
after we got him,” remarked Teddy.</p>

<p>“Was he afraid the goat would butt him?”
asked Hal.</p>

<p>“No, I guess he was afraid Nicknack
would get away and not come back,” Teddy
answered. “But come on! That Punch and
Judy show is going to start.”</p>

<p>Boys and girls, and some of the grown
folks, were gathering at the lower end of
the hall, and behind the curtains could be
seen something moving. Down underneath
was hidden the man who made the queer
little doll-images go through their funny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
capers, moving about and seeming to speak.
Though really, of course, it was the man
himself, hidden behind the curtain, doing
the talking.</p>

<p>“Hello, everybody!” squeaked Mr. Punch,
as he paraded across on the tiny stage, and
he shook his hands at the children (or at
least he seemed to be doing that) and all the
children laughed while the grown-ups
smiled.</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of anybody!” cried Mr.
Punch, as he shook his stick. “I’m not
afraid even of Nicknack the goat!”</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” laughed Teddy and Janet,
while Hal and some others joined in.
Everyone looked at the Curlytops.</p>

<p>“I’d like to have a ride on Nicknack,”
went on Mr. Punch. “Oh, I’m not afraid
of him! I’ll show him how to do it!” and
he banged his stick down with a loud whack
that made the children jump.</p>

<p>“How’d he know about our goat?” asked
Janet in surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess somebody must have told
him,” Hal said. “Once, when I lived at
home, they took me to a Punch and Judy
show, and the man who worked it made a
lot of jokes about the boys and girls. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
guess their fathers and mothers told him to.
It was lots of fun.”</p>

<p>Mr. Punch kept on talking and acting in
a most funny and jolly way and soon the
roomful of children was laughing.</p>

<p>“Where’s Trouble?” suddenly asked Ted,
looking at his sister, while they were waiting
for the next scene in the Punch and
Judy show.</p>

<p>“He was here a minute ago,” she answered.
“I guess he went back to mother,”
for Mrs. Martin was in the rear of the hall
with some other ladies.</p>

<p>Ted and Janet were wondering whether
they had better not go and look for their
little brother when the curtain of the little
Punch and Judy theater opened and a real
man, and not one of the doll-images, looked
out and said:</p>

<p>“Some one has taken the funny little bear
I use in the next part of the show. Has any
little boy or girl been playing around my
booth and taken the bear?”</p>

<p>There was silence a moment, and then
from the back of the hall up piped the voice
of Trouble, saying:</p>

<p>“I’se got it! I was goin’ to show him to
my goat!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>Everybody laughed when Baby William
came walking up with the toy bear which
had a part in the show. The little boy, wandering
around behind the curtain when no
show was going on, had opened the draperies
and taken out the little bear. He gave
it back to the man.</p>

<p>“Ah, now the show can go on,” said the
man, as he pulled the curtain over the stage.
And when the laughter had stopped, and
everything was ready, the curtain was thrust
aside once more and Mr. Punch cried:</p>

<p>“That’s the way to do it! That’s the way
I do it!”</p>

<p>And so the entertainment went on until
the fair came to an end, and the children
went home, talking about what they had
seen and heard.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad they didn’t make all the
money they wanted,” said Grandpa Martin
at Cherry Farm the following day. “I wish
I had lots of dollars, so I could give as much
as I’d like. But with poor crops, and the
farm not paying well, I can’t—that’s all,”
and he shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“When are you going to pick the cherries?”
asked Ted. “They must be ripe
now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>“They are, and ready to pick. I never
saw so many! Why, I’ll have to give them
away I guess, to get rid of them. I never
had such a crop. There are bushels and
bushels of them!”</p>

<p>“What—goats?” asked a voice behind the
Curlytops, and, turning, they saw the jolly
lollypop man.</p>

<p>“What have you so much of?” he asked.
He had left his red wagon and white horse
in the road, and had come up to the porch
on which the Curlytops were seated talking
to grandpa.</p>

<p>“It’s cherries I have so many of, not
goats,” was Mr. Martin’s answer. “I have
the biggest crop in years, and I don’t know
where to sell them.”</p>

<p>“Then I can tell you where, and you will
get a good price for them,” replied the lollypop
man. “That’s what I came to see you
about.”</p>

<p>“Do you come to buy my cherries?” asked
Grandpa Martin.</p>

<p>“That’s what I do,” was the reply. “I
don’t want them for myself though, but for
a man from whom I buy my lollypops. This
man has a big candy factory, and he is going
to make a new kind of sweets called ‘Chewing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
Cherry Candy.’ He has made a little
for samples, and it sells better, even, than
my lollypops and waffles. I know, for I have
tried it.”</p>

<p>Ted and Jan were growing excited.</p>

<p>“To make this candy lots of cherries are
needed. The manufacturer is in the market
for bushels and bushels of ’em, and so far
hasn’t been able to get half of what he wants.
I told one of his men about the big crop up
here and especially about this grove on
Cherry Farm, and I’ve come now to buy up
all I can. He’ll pay big and he’ll give me a
good commission and he’ll get plenty of the
finest cherries in the world, so everything is
all right for everybody and the world is a
fine place.”</p>

<p>“Well, that certainly is good news!” cried
Grandpa Martin. “Why, if I can sell all my
cherries I’ll have some money, no matter if
the flood did spoil most of my crops.”</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t that be great!” cried Ted in
delight.</p>

<p>“And if you sell enough cherries you can
give some money to the Crippled Home,
can’t you?” asked Janet, softly.</p>

<p>“I can and will, my dear,” said Grandpa
Martin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>“Let’s go and look at the cherries,” said
the lollypop man. “Hurray!”</p>

<p>Oh, what a lot of cherries there were! No
wonder Grandpa Martin’s place was called
Cherry Farm! The trees in the grove bent
down their branches which were laden with
red cherries and black. Some were purple,
and when the Curlytops ate them their faces
and hands were all stained.</p>

<p>“’Ist like we tipped over de ink bottle!”
laughed Trouble, who was given one or two
cherries, not enough to make him ill, but
enough to color him.</p>

<p>Then there were some big white cherries,
with red cheeks, and Grandpa Martin called
them “ox-hearts.” And when the Curlytops
asked him why, not seeing anything about
them like an ox, they were told the cherries
had that name because of their large size.</p>

<p>“You have the finest crop of cherries of
anyone around here!” said the lollypop man
when he had gone through the grove. “My
friend, the candy man, will buy all you want
to sell, and pay you well. Then you will have
plenty of money.”</p>

<p>“I’ll sell all my wife doesn’t want to can,
and all these little Curlytops don’t want to
eat,” laughed Grandpa Martin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>“Oh, how glad I am!” cried Jan. “Now
grandpa can give some money to Hal’s Crippled
Home!”</p>

<p>And so Grandpa Martin could. His
cherries sold for much more money than
ever before, being sent to the factory where
the Chewing Cherry Candy was made. And,
a little later, the lollypop man drove past
the house with his red wagon and white horse
and called:</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! Oh, ho! I love a goat. Come
see my white coat, and get some cherry
candy! Oh, ho! Oh, ho! Come get cherry
candy!”</p>

<p>This the Curlytops did, and they said the
new cherry chewing candy was the best they
had ever eaten. Perhaps it was because it
had in it some of Grandpa Martin’s
cherries.</p>

<p>At any rate Grandpa Martin was given
quite a sum of money for his cherry crop,
and he could afford to give the hundred dollars
to the Home for Crippled Children.</p>

<p>“Is Hal going to be cured?” asked Ted
one day, after he, with Jan and Trouble, had
been for a ride with Nicknack.</p>

<p>“The doctor is going to try to cure him
to-morrow,” said Mother Martin. “We are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
to go over the day following and see how
he is.”</p>

<p>And when they went, they found Hal sitting
in an easy chair, his feet and legs covered
with blankets. He was very pale, but
he smiled.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Jan a bit sadly, “can’t
you—walk?”</p>

<p>“He will soon walk better than ever,” said
the nurse softly.</p>

<p>“And then you’ll see me chase after the
Mosquito Dwarf and drive him away from
Princess Blue Eyes!” laughed Hal. “Just
wait! I’ll run a race with Nicknack soon.”</p>

<p>“But don’t get our goat too tired,” said
Jan. “For we may want to give the Princess
Blue Eyes a ride.”</p>

<p>“That’s so!” laughed Hal. “We’ll ride
her to her golden throne, down by the ocean
waves where the green palms grow, and
then——”</p>

<p>He stopped and seemed to be looking
away, past the white clouds that were scudding
across the blue sky.</p>

<p>“Then what?” asked Jan, for she thought
it sounded like a story in which one has
stopped after telling halfway through.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Hal softly, “maybe the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
Princess Blue Eyes won’t need me any
more.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes she will!” put in Ted. “There’s
lots of mosquitoes left yet. I feel ’em biting
me!”</p>

<p>And a few weeks later Hal could walk as
straight as anyone, though he had to go
slowly until his leg and foot fully healed.
But he was very happy, and so were many
other boys and girls in the Home who were
cured and made more comfortable, because
of the money Grandpa Martin gave when he
sold so many cherries.</p>

<p>Then followed many fine vacation days at
Cherry Farm. I could not begin to tell you
all the Curlytops did if I had a book twice
the size of this one. But I can tell you about
some of the things in another book to be
called “The Curlytops on Star Island; Or,
Camping Out with Grandpa.” In that you
may read how Ted and Jan, to say nothing
of Trouble, went to the island in Clover
Lake, and had many adventures.</p>

<p>“Well, what shall we do to-day?” asked
Ted of Jan, as they went out on the porch
one morning, about a week after Hal had
been cured and the chewing cherry candy
made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>“Let’s go for a ride with Nicknack,” said
Jan.</p>

<p>As they were going back to the stable
where they kept their goat, they heard some
one calling:</p>

<p>“Stop it now! You stop it!”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Janet.</p>

<p>“Sounds like Trouble,” answered Ted.</p>

<p>It was Trouble. Baby William had taken
Nicknack’s rope, by which the goat was tied
to a stake just outside the barn, and this
rope the little fellow had made fast to a
wheelbarrow. Trouble wanted to have Nicknack
pull him, but every time the goat
straightened out the rope the wheelbarrow
would upset, and Trouble, who had climbed
in to get a ride, would be spilled out. But
he fell on the soft grass and was not hurt.</p>

<p>“Oh, Trouble! What <i>are</i> you doing?”
cried Jan, as her little brother tipped over
for perhaps the fifth time, though of course
Nicknack did not mean to do it.</p>

<p>“Me goin’ to gib rides an’ make money to
buy cherries—’cause grandpa’s all goned,”
was the answer. “Giddap, ole Nicknack!”</p>

<p>Nicknack, reaching for a choice bit of
grass, overturned the wheelbarrow again,
and out popped the little boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>“Oh, you dear bunch of Trouble!” cried
Mother Martin, as she laughingly ran to pick
him up. “You are always doing something!”</p>

<p>And so he was. But, for that matter, so
were the Curlytops. And, leaving them to
have more fun on Cherry Farm, we will say
good-bye.</p>
